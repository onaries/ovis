 * The second does not wait on the first: an unmanaged server names no commit, an older one may not
 * answer at all, a build outside Git has none, and a rebuild of the same commit compares equal,
 * yet the part is gone for this page until it is reloaded. Nothing while an update is underway.
 *
 * "restart" is "updated" where a reload cannot help: the server serves the files of a source
 * checkout that was rebuilt under it, and this tab is already that build, so a reload loads the
 * same build again. It ends when the server is restarted and reports the commit the tab was built
 * from. A part of this page that failed to load is still "incomplete": only a reload brings it.
