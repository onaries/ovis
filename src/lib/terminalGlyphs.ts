/**
 * xterm's DOM renderer sizes every cell from the Latin font and gives each glyph the
 * difference to its cells as letter-spacing, which lands after the glyph: a narrower glyph
 * sits at the left edge of its cells. With a 1em CJK fallback beside a 0.54em Latin cell
 * (Linux) that leftover is a pixel. Apple's Menlo cell is 0.6em, though, and no font on
 * iPhone draws Hangul wider than 0.87em, so every syllable trailed a 4px gap and Korean read
 * as falling apart (kana and Han too, at 0.87em to 1em).
 *
 * So each span the renderer draws with extra spacing is adjusted after the fact:
 * - a glyph in two cells that fills less than FILL of them is drawn larger, up to
 *   MAX_SCALE, the way a CJK coding font sizes it against its Latin;
 * - the glyph is centered in its cells: padding moves the text right by half the spacing
 *   left over, a negative margin takes it back after the span so the next span keeps its
 *   column, and a clip trims the trailing half so a background or block cursor stays on its
 *   own cells.
 * A glyph wider than its cells is left to run over, as in a native terminal.
 *
 * The renderer also hands the browser each cell's text as written, and two kinds of text
 * draw wrong on iPhone:
 * - iOS Safari draws only the first of two stacked marks on a decomposed letter (`e` +
 *   U+0302 + U+0301, as in a Vietnamese file name from a Mac), so such text is shown composed
 *   (NFC), and decomposed Hangul with it, which then measures as the syllable it is;
 * - iOS draws a symbol that is text by default, such as ⏺ (the bullet before every Claude
 *   Code message), as a color emoji two cells wide in its one cell, so a symbol that
 *   overflows its cell is asked for its text form (U+FE0E).
 * Copy reads xterm's buffer, not the DOM, and still returns what the pane wrote.
 *
 * Box-drawing and block characters are not text to fit at all: each is replaced by a
 * cell-sized box with its lines painted in (terminalBoxGlyphs.ts).

   * The icon font and the Hangul face are fetched only once a pane prints an icon or Korean that

   * measured those characters with whatever stood in for them, and both keep what they measured. So
   * a character drawn while a face that covers it has not loaded follows that face
   * (followLateFaces): its own `loaded` promise tells when it arrives, as no event can (WebKit, in
   * Safari and Ovis for Mac's window, fires no `loadingdone` for a face a stylesheet loads). Then,
   * once a frame whatever number of faces arrived, the widths here start over, the font family is
   * set again in a form that reads differently and means the same, so xterm measures anew, and every
   * row is drawn again: xterm keeps the rows it drew while the cell stays the same size, and only a
   * row drawn again is fitted again. The widths are cleared here rather than when the family reads
   * differently: two arrivals set it back as it was. A face that never loads leaves the fallback as
   * measured.
