/**
 * The alert sound: a short chime the open tab plays itself when an alert is due. It is page
 * audio, not a system notification, so it is heard where notifications stay quiet - a macOS
 * Focus, Do Not Disturb - as long as a tab of the app is open.
 *
 * A browser lets a page play audio only after the user interacted with it, so the audio context
 * is made and resumed from a tap or key (`unlockAlertSound`); until then a chime is skipped,
 * never queued to sound late.
 *
 * One chime sounds at a time in a tab. Alerts that come together - several panes finishing at
 * once - would otherwise sound over each other. An alert that comes while a chime sounds is
 * already told by it, except a question after a finish: the question's chime starts where the
 * finish's ends, so a question is never lost. `alertTurns.ts` coordinates eligible tabs by
 * machine, pane and kind. An alert deferred to another tab stays pending until that tab
 * confirms it chimed, or a local deadline/withdrawal lets this tab tell it instead.
