/**
 * A phone's bottom sheet is a history entry, so the system Back closes it instead of going to the
 * pane before (deep links make each pane its own entry). The entry keeps the address it opened on.
 * What an item of the sheet does with the history takes the sheet's entry over: a navigation it
 * pushes (another pane, Settings, a file) replaces the entry, a sheet it opens reuses it, and an
 * address it changes on the entry (the New tab dialog) keeps it. A sheet closed any other way steps
 * back off its entry once whatever it ran has written its own history. A sheet closed by Back
 * leaves its entry ahead of the app; Forward onto it goes on to the next. A sheet opened while
 * that step back is on its way (the browser runs a traversal later) is not closed by the step's
 * popstate: its entry is made again over where the step landed. So is a sheet made to stay up
 * under what opens over it (a terminal peek under the ⋯ menu or Settings), whose entry another
 * sheet or a navigation took: the traversal that leaves what covered it, a Back or that sheet's
 * own close, does not close it. Any other sheet still up under a new one closes with it, as before.
