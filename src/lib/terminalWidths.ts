/**
 * herdr lays out its screen with current Unicode widths: an emoji takes two cells, and so
 * does a whole emoji sequence (ZWJ family, skin tone, flag, keycap, an emoji-presentation
 * selector after a text symbol like ⚠️). Its attach stream counts on the browser's xterm
 * advancing the cursor exactly as far. xterm defaults to Unicode 6 widths, where most emoji
 * take one cell and a ZWJ sequence takes one per emoji, so the rest of the line shifted:
 * emoji overlapped the next letter, and parts of a sequence were overwritten (👨‍👩‍👧 lost the
 * 👧) or left behind as stale characters.
 *
 * xterm's grapheme addon brings Unicode 15 widths and emoji sequences, and it agrees with
 * herdr in all but four places, each corrected here:
 * - it joins a spacing mark (Thai SARA AM in น้ำ, a Devanagari vowel sign) to the letter
 *   before it as one cell, where herdr gives the mark its own cell, so a spacing mark starts
 *   a cell of its own;
 * - its tables predate Unicode 14 emoji (🫠), which it counts as one cell, so an emoji the
 *   browser knows as emoji-presentation takes two cells, and joins like any other emoji;
 * - it gives invisible format characters (zero-width space, direction marks, word joiner,
 *   Hangul filler) a cell, where herdr gives them none, so they join the cell before them.
 *   Characters that build emoji sequences (ZWJ, variation selectors, tags) and the Hangul
 *   jamo stay with the addon;
 * - it keeps an emoji two cells wide when the text-presentation selector (U+FE0E) follows,
 *   where herdr and herdr-core give an emoji that has a text form (⚽︎, ⌚︎; not 😀︎) one cell,
 *   and keep it at one through any selector after it (a ZWJ sequence after it is two cells,
 *   a skin tone after it a cell of its own). The cell narrows on the selector, as
 *   the patched xterm then gives back the second column (patches/@xterm%2Fxterm@6.0.0.patch).
