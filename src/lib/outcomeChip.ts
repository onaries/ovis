/**
 * What became of a command sent from Chat, under its bubble. The bridge tracks each command it
 * sent as a CommandOutcome (shared/protocol.ts), read with the prompt poll: accepted only says the
 * bridge sent it, and the chip moves on from there on correlated evidence alone. A changed screen is
 * a preview folded under the chip, never a state; a typed-only command is never done.
 *
 * The chip sits on the transcript turn that records the command. A command the transcript keeps no
 * turn for (Claude's /btw, an informational command) gets a provisional sent row of its own, placed
 * by send time; a later user turn matching the text takes the chip over and the row goes, so nothing
 * shows twice.
