/**
 * Returns to the top-level history entry beneath an overlay. A page in an iframe can add its own
 * history entries (including hash links), so a one-step `history.back()` may only move the frame.
 * Navigation API entries belong to this window and let the close action skip those frame entries.
 * Browsers without the Navigation API fall back to one history step (`steps` of them).
 *
 * The step is the overlay's own, and the sheets are told so (sheetStep.goingBack): it is no Back of
 * the user's, so a dialog still up under the overlay (Files under a file closed by its X) stays and
 * keeps its entry, and a sheet's entry lying over the overlay's is stepped over too.
