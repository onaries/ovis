/**
 * Settings in the browser's history. The system Back button (Android's, a swipe from the screen's
 * edge) traverses history, and a dialog that is no entry of it is skipped: Back left the app
 * instead of the page. So each step into Settings is an entry above the app: the dialog, the
 * page a phone opens from its list, the key bar editor. Back takes them off one at a time.
 *
 * The dialog says what is shown as a list of levels (`recordSettings`); this module makes the
 * history hold exactly those entries, pushing the missing ones and stepping back over the ones
 * no longer shown (a Back control in the dialog, its X, Escape). It tells its listeners when a
 * traversal lands, and whether it was one of its own.
