/**
 * A press that selects another pane can move what it pressed before the release: the selection
 * closes a file docked beside the panes, and the panes widen under the pointer (#3368). The browser
 * then sends the press's click to an element holding the button or link, not to it. This sends that
 * click on to the pressed button or link when it lands where that was when pressed; a release
 * dragged off that place still cancels the click, as it does on one that stayed put.
 *
 * The browser's own click is cancelled when handed on: a tap's click comes from a new hit test and
 * could press whatever moved under the finger as well. A press that never makes a click (a long
 * press, a release outside the window) stops waiting at the next press or when the window loses
 * focus, so a later click there does not press it.
