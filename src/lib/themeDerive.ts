/**
 * Every colour the app draws, from the sixteen of a Base16 scheme (https://github.com/chriskempson/base16):
 * the public contract of an imported theme (customThemes.ts) is those sixteen seeds, never the
 * app's own roles, so a role can be renamed, split or added here without breaking a theme file.
 *
 * The scheme's own colours are kept wherever they read: a colour moves only when it is under a
 * floor of themeContrast.ts, and then only its lightness, by the smallest step that clears the
 * floor on every surface it is drawn on (its chroma gives way only when no lightness does). A
 * surface the text could only be read on by moving far gives way to the text instead, and a
 * hovered or selected row always tells from the ground. So any sixteen colours, however they were
 * chosen, come out as a theme the contrast test of the built-in themes would pass.
