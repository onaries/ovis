 * there. Settings, Devices and PCs keeps saying it. One dismissal covers one PC at one address: the
 * line comes back when the address changes, or once a health answer says direct is off and it is
 * turned on again. The open-server warning (`lan_exposure`) is never dismissed.
 *
 * `scope` names the PC whose storage this is: its server id in the hosted shell, whose origin all
