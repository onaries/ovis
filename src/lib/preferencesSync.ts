/**
 * Keeps the shared settings, the pins and the muted panes (shared/preferences.ts) the same in every browser of this
 * server. Loaded once the app is in (never before the access gate): what the server holds is laid
 * over this browser's settings, setting by setting; a setting nobody has shared yet stays this
 * browser's own, and opening a page writes nothing. A change here sends just what changed, once the
 * settings rest; another browser's arrives as a `preferences` event, and the server sends its whole
 * document each time the event stream opens, so a reconnected page catches up. Last write wins,
 * setting by setting: a change made here and not yet sent stays, and goes out over what arrived.
 * After three failed saves in a row, sending pauses: the change stays in this page, edits made then
 * join it, and it goes again on Retry, when the event stream reopens, or once a longer wait ends (each
 * refusal after the pause doubles it). A value the server refused, still as it was sent, gives way
 * where another browser saved the same setting (or the pins) since: sent late, it would overwrite the
 * newer value. A value changed here after the refusal is a new change, and goes out over what arrived
 * as any does. While the event stream is lost, nothing goes out on its own either: its reopening sends
 * what is unsent. A stream the browser gave up on (App opens a new one) holds back only a refused
 * change, until the new stream's opening document is read; anything else goes, so a refusal shows.
