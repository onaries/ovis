 * The panes whose alerts are off, shared with the other browsers of the server (the
 * `muted_panes` of shared/preferences.ts, through lib/preferencesSync.ts). One list for every
 * channel: push, the in-app alert, the chime and the tab notification all read it
 * (shared/notify-policy.ts paneAlertsMuted). A pane is keyed with its PC, as the alerts key it
 * (`paneStorageId`), so a pane id reused on another PC never inherits the mute.
 *
 * Nothing is kept in this browser: the server's document is the list, so it is null until a
 * document that carries it arrives, and stays null on a server too old to keep one; then no
 * row offers a mute, and no empty list is ever made up and sent.
