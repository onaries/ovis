/**
 * The server is answering on an address beyond this PC with no access token set and no device
 * paired, so anything that can reach that address is let in. It says so and does nothing about
 * it: pairing or a token is the owner's decision, and the default stays what it is
 * (`server/access.ts`, `lanExposed`).
 *
 * Not dismissible. This is the server's state rather than an event, so it leaves when the
 * state does — and a dismissed warning would not come back when the state returned.
