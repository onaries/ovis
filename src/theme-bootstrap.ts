/**
 * The page's first script: a classic, blocking one in <head> (scripts/theme-bootstrap-build.ts puts
 * it there), so it runs before the stylesheet or the app can paint. It draws the saved theme's row
 * on the document the way the app will (lib/themeBoot.ts), so a cold launch shows that row from its
 * first frame instead of the stylesheet's default until React applies the settings.
 * Same-origin and external, never inline: the app's policy allows `script-src 'self'` only.
