// Service worker for Ovis. Policy: navigations are network-first (so a
// fresh build always wins when online) falling back to the cached shell when
// offline; static assets (hashed bundles, icons, favicons) are cache-first since
// they are content-addressed or rarely change. The web manifest is not: its URL
// never changes and the browser rereads it to update the installed app, so a
// cached copy would pin every install to its first manifest. API and websocket
// traffic is never intercepted so live workspace data is always fresh.
// Nothing is precached. The typefaces are /assets/ files too (src/fonts/fonts.css): Pretendard
// comes as 92 chunks split by unicode-range and the browser asks only for those whose characters
// a page draws, so each is cached as it is first fetched and a phone that has shown Korean once
// draws it offline. Never list them for install: that would download all 3 MB on every device.
// A new cache starts empty for the same reason, so the cache of the name before it is kept
// until this one holds a shell and the files it starts with: the page that brought this worker
// was loaded through the old one, and its shell, bundles and font chunks are all there. Deleted
// at activation, the first reload without a network would find no shell at all. Only the new
// build's files (BUILD_FILES), the retired shell's entry files, typefaces and icons are copied
// across, so no other bundle of an old build outlives the first navigation that reaches the server.
// Every build is a worker of its own: the build stamps BUILD into dist/sw.js
// (scripts/service-worker-build.ts), so its cache is named after it and the last build's
// bundles go with the last build's cache. CACHE_NAME is the part a person moves.
// The typefaces and icons are not a build's: a font chunk's name changes only with its contents,
// and most are the same file release after release. They live in FILES, which no build retires,
// so an update does not cost a phone the glyphs it had drawn offline.
// BUILD_FILES, stamped beside BUILD, names the build's own /assets/ files (names only, no typefaces).
// A file of this build that the worker before kept (the reload after an update is still answered
// by it, KaTeX or Mermaid fetched early among them) is moved into this cache when that one is
// retired, and a file of another build is not copied forward. A worker no build stamped has no
// list: any file is copied forward, as before.
// A retired cache's own shell keeps its entry script and stylesheet here too: a page that started
// from that shell offline and has not asked for them yet still boots, then offers a reload.
