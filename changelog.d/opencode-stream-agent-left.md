### Fixed
- Ovis lets go of OpenCode's event stream within seconds of OpenCode leaving its last pane, even
  when herdr says nothing of it (seen on a busy host): herdr may change the pane's agent without an
  event, or keep calling it OpenCode with only the shell left in front. A pane that holds the stream
  is now read again each time its check is due, and the shell alone in front releases it. On Linux,
  the pane's own OpenCode stopped with Ctrl+Z keeps it, also when started through a launcher such as
  `npx`, so a message sent before is still followed after `fg`; another OpenCode stopped in the same
  shell does not. On macOS, a stopped OpenCode still releases it.
