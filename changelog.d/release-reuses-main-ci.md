### Maintenance
- The Release run no longer runs the whole CI a second time when main's own CI run already passed
  the same commit: it takes that run, waiting up to 40 minutes for one still going, and still runs
  Fast checks itself, beside that wait and on GitHub's runner, where the unit tests the self-hosted
  runner skips run.
  It runs the whole CI itself whenever main's run is missing, failed, was rerun more than once or
  cannot be read. Its new `revalidate` input runs the whole CI in the Release run as before, and
  **Actions → Release validation** is a dry run of the decision that publishes nothing.
