/**
 * The device's side of pairing with a typed code (shared/relay-pair-code.ts): one CPace exchange
 * with the PC on the relay's rendezvous for the code's nameplate, which ends in the PC's pairing
 * offer, or in why not. Exactly one exchange per call: a call is one tap on Pair, and nothing here
 * tries again with the code it was given, so a relay acting as the PC gets one guess per tap.
 * The offer is then checked as a scanned link's is (its key must give its PC id) and must carry a
 * pairing code; the hosted shell, or Settings → Remote PCs on a PC that adds another, shows the
 * PC's ID to compare before it pairs with it.
