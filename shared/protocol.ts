 * defaults; route CSP, framing, MIME, caching and compression policies still win.

 *  watch requires the "watch" feature: a read-only view of the pane drawn for the client's grid
 *  (`herdr terminal session observe`), which, unlike an attach, leaves the pane at the size herdr's

   * works the bridge keeps the message until its next turn, or the owner explicitly steers it.
   * `delivery:hold` (feature "pending-hold") is the same, except the message is kept as held, also
   * when it arrives after the turn ended: it never goes on its own, only when the owner steers it.
   * Omission keeps the legacy immediate submission. Queued messages never resume after lease loss.
   * Queue request ids increase monotonically per connection; recent duplicates replay their
   * receipt, and retired ids are rejected rather than executed after history eviction.
   * `delivery:agent-queue` requires "agent-queue" and a live interact attachment to an actual
   * OmO process (Ctrl+Q), or a working Codex process (Tab, feature "codex-agent-queue"):
   * literal bracketed paste then the native queue key, never Enter or bridge pending input.
   * It refuses typed/clear_draft and prompts; its receipt confirms key delivery only, not
   * native queue acceptance. It uses the same bounded request-id receipts as queue delivery.
   * `clear_draft`: an immediate chat message only, sent again over the `draft` its input_draft
   * refusal named: the server clears Claude's input box first while it still holds exactly that,
   * and refuses again (input_draft) when it holds anything else or does not read empty after.
   * `send_anyway`: an immediate chat message only, sent again after an input_draft refusal that
   * named no draft and showed the box (`box`): the server sends once over that box, only into the same
   * Claude terminal and session that refusal was for (else pending_target_changed), and only while the
   * box still shows that `box` or reads empty (else input_draft again, with the new box). Not with
   * `clear_draft`.
   * `resend_id`: stable held-copy ID for immediate or native-queue chat resends across connections; the bridge
   * shares the first outcome for 60 seconds after settlement. `resend_generation` defaults to 0;
   * only a definitive no-input refusal permits the next attempt generation. Not with `send_anyway`:
   * that combination returns invalid_delivery before reserving or replaying an ID. No `clear_draft`.
   * Older peers ignore it. */
