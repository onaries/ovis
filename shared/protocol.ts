 *  and that visitor do. That visitor drives like a paired device but leaves no standing access behind: the
 *  changes under /api/devices/ (a code redeemed at /api/devices/pair apart), POST /api/push/subscribe,
 *  POST /api/portal/* and POST /api/relay/* answer it 403 owner_only. Without a token, and while no
 *  device is paired, anything that reaches the server is let in as before (the startup
 *  warning says so). Refusals answer 401 `unauthorized` (403 `other_user` for another Tailscale
 *  login, when no token is configured); the upgrade is refused. Static files are always public.

 * - Issuance: an answer to GET /api/machines/events or POST /api/push/subscribe that is served
 *   (2xx) to a request carrying no valid key adds one: `Set-Cookie: ovis_stream_<key>=1;
 *   Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Max-Age=31536000` (plus `Secure` over https), `<key>` 32
 *   lowercase hex characters from 16 random bytes. A request that carries one is issued nothing.
 * - Format: the key is in the cookie's NAME and the value is always `1`. Tabs that open at once,
 *   before the browser held a key, each get one; since the names differ the browser keeps them
 *   all, and every later request carries every key. At most eight are read from one request. A
 *   cookie with the prefix whose key is not 32 lowercase hex, or whose value is not `1`, is not a
 *   key and is ignored (never refused); a request with none is treated as a browser without one.
 * - Lifetime: one year, like the device cookie, so a push subscription and the browser that made
 *   it keep matching. Nothing revokes a key: it names a browser and grants nothing.
 * - No authority: a key never lets a request in, never selects an owner or a role, and is not read
 *   by the gate. Losing one only means that browser may hear of its own next pairing.
 * - Role in POST /api/devices/pair: the keys the pairing request carries are the enrollment's
 *   origin (kept with a first-pair credential until its first return). The `device-paired` event
 *   then skips every machines event stream opened with one of those keys, and the push notice
 *   skips every subscription registered with one, whatever access it came through (token, this
 *   PC, Tailscale or a paired device).

 *  a phone watching a pane can never change the size the operator's PC sees. The client
 *  re-sends its role before the attach replay on reconnect.
 *  secret requires the "secret-input" feature, an interact attachment, a matching fresh
 *  prompt and an idle input queue. Its result contains only ok/code, never the value.
 *  watch requires the "watch" feature: a read-only view of the pane drawn for the client's grid
 *  (`herdr terminal session observe`), which, unlike an attach, leaves the pane at the size herdr's
 *  own window gives it. It is not an attach: no input, resize, ACK or input-ready. A tab out of use
 *  detaches and watches; it attaches again when the user is back. One watch per pane and connection;
 *  a second watch for the same pane starts it again at the new grid. watch-end: the view ended
 *  (unwatch does not answer one), and a pane the view could not start for gets one at once. At most
 *  64 panes watched per connection: one more gets its watch-end at once, with no error. A view asked
 *  for as another is given up starts once that one's process has ended. A `pane_id` that is no
 *  string, is blank, begins with a hyphen (blanks before it aside), holds a control character or is
 *  longer than 256 characters answers `invalid_watch`.

   * refusal named: the server clears Claude's input box first while it still holds exactly that,
   * and refuses again (input_draft) when it holds anything else or does not read empty after.
   * `send_anyway`: an immediate chat message only, sent again after an input_draft refusal that
   * named no draft and showed the box (`box`): the server sends once over that box, only into the same
   * Claude terminal and session that refusal was for (else pending_target_changed), and only while the
