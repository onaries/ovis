 * The text an `insert` frame may carry (ClientMessage `insert`, feature "terminal-insert"): the
 * terminal draft typed into the pane without Enter. The server and the demo check a frame with
 * this before anything is typed, so a refusal is the same everywhere.
 *
 * An Insert types one line. Several lines would be safe only as one bracketed paste into a program
 * that turned bracketed paste on, and nothing here can tell that it did: herdr's API reports no
 * terminal modes, and `herdr terminal attach` opens its stream with its own ESC[?2004h whatever the
 * program in the pane set (measured on herdr 0.9.5: a program that wrote ESC[?2004l got the same
 * preamble as one that wrote ESC[?2004h). A shell would run each bare line, and an Insert never
 * presses Enter, so a line break is refused (`unsafe_multiline`) rather than a mode inferred; the
 * paste markers themselves are escapes, refused with every other control byte.
