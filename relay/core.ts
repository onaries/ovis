/**
 * The Ovis relay's routing, shared by the Cloudflare Worker (worker.ts) and the Bun server
 * (bun.ts). A PC and a phone that cannot reach each other both dial out to the relay, which pairs
 * their sockets by the PC's `server_id` and passes frames between them unread: the frames are
 * end-to-end encrypted between the two (README.md). Nothing here parses, logs or keeps a frame
 * beyond the short wait for the PC's data socket, and nothing is stored.
 *
 * Three kinds of socket meet in one room per `server_id` (`GET /v1/ws?server_id=..&v=1`):
 * - control (`role=server`): one per PC. It hears `sync`, `connected` and `disconnected` (JSON
 *   text) about clients, and sends nothing but keepalive pings.
 * - client (`role=client`): a phone or browser. The relay picks its `connection_id` and says so
 *   in its first frame, `{"type":"assigned","connection_id":"..."}`.
 * - data (`role=server&connection_id=..`): the PC's socket for one client, opened once the PC
 *   hears `connected` (or `sync`) for it. Frames then pass between client and data as they came.
 * - warm (`role=server&warm=<generation>`): a data socket the PC opened and proved before any
 *   client came, once `sync` said this relay takes one and named the control socket's generation
 *   (`"warm":"<32 hex>"`, new for every control socket). The next client to arrive while that
 *   control socket is connected takes it at once: it hears `{"type":"bound","connection_id":".."}`
 *   before any of the client's frames and is that client's data socket from then on, and the
 *   control socket hears no `connected` for that client. The PC then opens the next one. At most
 *   MAX_WARM wait per PC; one of another generation is refused, and one not bound closes with its
 *   control socket.
 *
 * A PC socket (control or data) offers the PC's public key, from which its `server_id` is derived,
 * and is no part of the room until it answers a challenge only the matching secret key can answer
 * (shared/relay-server-proof.ts): knowing a `server_id` is not enough to take a PC's place. A
 * client holds one of a server's MAX_CLIENTS slots only once the PC has answered it (its data
 * socket sent a frame); until then it is one of at most MAX_PENDING, closed HANDSHAKE_MS after the
 * PC could have answered.
 *
 * The room keeps no state that must outlive the process (or a Durable Object's eviction): who is
 * who lives with each socket (`RoomHost.info`), and a PC that reconnects gets the clients still
 * waiting in `sync`.
 *
 * Usage counters: a PC's control socket and each answered client count how long they stay
 * connected and how many bytes pass, and hand that to `RoomHost.usage` when the socket closes (and
 * every USAGE_REPORT_MS while it stays open). A report holds the server_id, which side, bytes each
 * way and the time; never a frame, an address or a connection_id.
