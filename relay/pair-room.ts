/**
 * The relay's rendezvous for pairing with a typed code (shared/relay-pair-code.ts,
 * docs/relay.md "Pairing with a typed code"): `GET /v1/pair?nameplate=<3>&role=host|guest&v=1`.
 * The PC holds the room for a nameplate (`host`); a device that typed the code joins it (`guest`),
 * one at a time. The two run CPace through it; the relay reads none of it and is not trusted to
 * keep any limit: the PC counts tries itself. These limits only stop abuse through an honest relay.
 *
 * Every guest gets a random attempt id. The host hears `{"type":"guest","attempt"}` and
 * `{"type":"gone","attempt"}`; a guest's binary frame reaches the host prefixed with its attempt
 * id, and a host's binary frame must start with the current guest's id, which is stripped (a frame
 * for an attempt that is over goes nowhere). `{"type":"drop","attempt"}` from the host ends that
 * guest only. A guest's text is never passed on. What each socket is lives in its own info, so a
 * Durable Object evicted between frames picks up as it was.
 *
 * A host may offer its PC's key (`&server_id=<32 hex>&public_key=<64 hex>`): it then answers a server
 * challenge for role `pair-host` and the nameplate (shared/relay-server-proof.ts) before it holds the
 * nameplate, and while it proves no device finds the code and no other host takes it. A relay that
 * asks for relay passes (pass.ts) lets in, while enforced, only a host whose pass holds for the key
 * it offers, and a host keeps its nameplate only while that holds: once passes are enforced (grace
 * reached its date) and its pass, if any, ran out, it closes 4402, its guest with it. The device that
 * joins never needs a pass.
