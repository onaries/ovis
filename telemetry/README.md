# Telemetry receiver

The Cloudflare Worker that receives the app's anonymous install and update counts and its daily
active message. What the app
sends and when is in [the guide](../docs/guide.md#anonymous-usage-counts); the sender is
`server/telemetry.ts`.

It stores one row per install, event and version in a D1 table (`schema.sql`): the day, the
event, the random install ID, the version and the version it replaced, the OS, the CPU
architecture, how the app was installed, and `settings`, a JSON snapshot validated by the shared
schema in `shared/telemetry.ts` (`NULL` when the sender has not provided one). The snapshot
contains only allowlisted enums, booleans and bounded numbers, never raw user-entered strings or
account identifiers. It adds the country the request came from: the two characters Cloudflare
works out from the sender's address (`request.cf.country`, such as `KR`), and nothing finer (no
city, region or network; a request Cloudflare marks as Tor or unknown is stored with no country).
A second table, `active`, holds one row per install and UTC day the app was opened in a browser
(`POST /v1/active`): the day, the random install ID, the version, the OS, the CPU architecture, how
the app was installed, the country, and `harnesses`, a JSON array of the kinds of coding agents
running that day, from the fixed list `TELEMETRY_HARNESSES` in `shared/telemetry.ts` (any other
agent is `other`). A later message for the same day replaces the version and the harnesses.
The Worker itself never reads the sender's address or any header other than the content type, and
Workers Logs are off (`wrangler.toml`), so no request log keeps the address either.

## Deploy

Prepare the database before deploying the Worker, then release the app version that sends
snapshots only after the Worker is deployed. On a brand-new database, create it and apply the
schema:

```sh
cd telemetry
bunx wrangler login
bunx wrangler d1 create herdr-web-ui-telemetry   # done once: its database_id is in wrangler.toml; only a new account repeats it
bunx wrangler d1 execute herdr-web-ui-telemetry --remote --file schema.sql
```

For an existing database, `schema.sql` does not add columns to its existing table. Add whichever
columns are missing, in this order, before deploying the Worker. A database that predates country
collection needs `country`:

```sh
bunx wrangler d1 execute herdr-web-ui-telemetry --remote --command "ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN country TEXT"
```

Then add `settings` to any existing database that does not have it:

```sh
bunx wrangler d1 execute herdr-web-ui-telemetry --remote --command "ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN settings TEXT"
```

Create the `active` table on an existing database too:

```sh
bunx wrangler d1 execute herdr-web-ui-telemetry --remote --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS active (day TEXT NOT NULL, install_id TEXT NOT NULL, version TEXT NOT NULL, os TEXT NOT NULL, arch TEXT NOT NULL, install_method TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (install_method IN ('plugin','managed','source')), country TEXT, harnesses TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (json_valid(harnesses)), PRIMARY KEY (day, install_id)); CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS active_day ON active (day);"
```

Then add `usage` to an `active` table that does not have it, before deploying a Worker that writes
it (an app since notice version 5 sends the day's usage; that Worker's insert fails on a table
without the column):

```sh
bunx wrangler d1 execute herdr-web-ui-telemetry --remote --command "ALTER TABLE active ADD COLUMN usage TEXT CHECK (usage IS NULL OR json_valid(usage))"
```

These ALTERs preserve historical rows; their newly added `settings` value remains `NULL` and is
not inferred from old data. After the database is ready, deploy the Worker and then release the
app version that sends snapshots:

```sh
bunx wrangler deploy
```

Then record the deploy with `bun scripts/release-guards.ts --worker-deployed` and commit
`telemetry/deployed.json`: a release whose Worker sources differ from the recorded ones fails. Any
edit to `telemetry/worker.ts` or `shared/telemetry.ts` counts, comments included, so a redeploy that
changes nothing is sometimes the price.

The Worker answers at `https://herdr-web-ui-telemetry.<account>.workers.dev/v1/events`, and
`TELEMETRY_URL` in `server/telemetry.ts` must name that address. `OVIS_TELEMETRY_URL` does not
exist on purpose: an install cannot be pointed elsewhere by its environment.

The Worker and its D1 database keep the `herdr-web-ui-telemetry` name they had before Ovis took its
name: installs already send to that address, and a D1 database cannot be renamed.

## Reading the counts

After `bunx wrangler login` from `telemetry/`, run
`bun scripts/telemetry-report.ts --out <file.md>` from the repository root. It runs the weekly installs, DAU, WAU, MAU,
agent-kind and country queries below, plus daily actives per country for the last 28 days, and
writes them as one report. The script selects `telemetry/` as Wrangler's working directory.
For the individual queries below, stay in `telemetry/`:

```sh
bunx wrangler d1 execute herdr-web-ui-telemetry --remote --command "<query>"
```

```sql
-- new installs per week
SELECT strftime('%Y-%W', day) AS week, COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE event = 'install' GROUP BY week ORDER BY week;
-- daily active installs (DAU)
SELECT day, COUNT(*) FROM active GROUP BY day ORDER BY day;
-- weekly active installs (WAU), the last 7 days including today
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT install_id) FROM active WHERE day >= date('now', '-6 days');
-- monthly active installs (MAU), the last 30 days including today
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT install_id) FROM active WHERE day >= date('now', '-29 days');
-- active installs per calendar month
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', day) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT install_id) FROM active GROUP BY month ORDER BY month;

SELECT harness.value AS harness, COUNT(DISTINCT active.install_id) AS installs

GROUP BY harness.value ORDER BY installs DESC, harness;

WHERE active.day >= date('now', '-29 days') AND active.usage IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY way.value ORDER BY installs DESC, ingress;
-- prompt answers sent and pane alerts delivered and tapped per day, with the installs that reported usage
SELECT day, COUNT(*) AS installs, SUM(json_extract(usage, '$.prompt_answers')) AS prompt_answers,
  SUM(json_extract(usage, '$.alerts_delivered')) AS alerts_delivered, SUM(json_extract(usage, '$.alerts_opened')) AS alerts_opened
FROM active WHERE usage IS NOT NULL GROUP BY day ORDER BY day;
-- installs per version they last reported
SELECT version, COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT install_id, MAX(version) AS version FROM events GROUP BY install_id) GROUP BY version ORDER BY version;
-- OS, architecture and install method
SELECT os, arch, install_method, COUNT(DISTINCT install_id) FROM events GROUP BY os, arch, install_method;
-- installs per country, each counted once under the last country it was seen in; NULL is an
-- install never seen with one (heard from only before the country was kept, or never named one)
SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT (SELECT country FROM events WHERE install_id = e.install_id AND country IS NOT NULL ORDER BY rowid DESC LIMIT 1) AS country
  FROM events e GROUP BY install_id
) GROUP BY country ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- values of every setting in the last non-NULL snapshot per install; installs with no snapshot
-- are excluded, and a later event with settings=NULL does not replace a prior snapshot
WITH latest_settings AS (
  SELECT install_id, settings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY install_id ORDER BY rowid DESC) AS recency
  FROM events
  WHERE settings IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT setting.key, setting.type, setting.value, COUNT(*) AS installs
FROM latest_settings
CROSS JOIN json_each(latest_settings.settings) AS setting
WHERE latest_settings.recency = 1
GROUP BY setting.key, setting.type, setting.value
ORDER BY setting.key, installs DESC, setting.type, setting.value;
-- a focused distribution using json_extract: theme in each install's last non-NULL snapshot
WITH latest_settings AS (
  SELECT install_id, settings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY install_id ORDER BY rowid DESC) AS recency
  FROM events
  WHERE settings IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT json_extract(settings, '$.theme') AS theme, COUNT(*) AS installs
FROM latest_settings
WHERE recency = 1
GROUP BY theme
ORDER BY installs DESC, theme;
```

`MAX(version)` compares text, which orders `0.10.0` before `0.9.0`; read the version table with
that in mind once a part reaches two digits.

Anyone can post an event that passes the checks, so the counts are a trend, not an audit.
