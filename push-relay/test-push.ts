/**
 * One real push through a deployed relay, to check the whole path after a deploy: registration,
 * the relay's request to APNs (which takes HTTP/2 only, so only a real APNs shows it works) or to
 * FCM (after signing in to Google with the relay's service account, which only Google can check),
 * and the phone. It registers the given token with a throwaway VAPID key, then sends one push
 * signed and encrypted with web-push as server/push.ts does. The keys are made here, not the
 * app's, so the phone cannot decrypt it and shows the fallback line ("herdr needs you").
 *
 *   bun push-relay/test-push.ts <APNs device token, hex> [production|sandbox] [relay origin]
 *   bun push-relay/test-push.ts fcm <FCM registration token> [relay origin]
 *
 * The relay answers 201 once APNs or FCM took the push. The endpoint it registered is never pushed
 * to again and expires with the others (ENDPOINT_TTL_SECONDS). An FCM token FCM calls invalid
 * (a made-up one) is answered 410, which only comes once the relay has signed in to Google.
