 * The relay's channel without the relay (docs/relay.md, "Direct on the same network"): a plain
 * WebSocket listener on this PC's private IPv4 addresses, and on its Tailscale one for a phone that
 * can open that (DIRECT_TAILNET), that a phone, told them in AUTH_OK
 * (DIRECT_CARRIER), opens instead of relay.ovis.sh. It speaks what the relay speaks to a client
 * (`/v1/ws`, an `assigned` frame, then the client's Noise records) and hands the socket to the same
 * RelaySession a relay data socket gets. No TLS: Noise against the PC key the phone pinned at pairing
 * proves this PC and protects the records, so an address is only ever a hint where to try.
 *
 * Narrower than the relay: devices sign in here, nothing pairs (RelaySession signInOnly). Clients
 * that have not signed in are bounded per source address and in total, apart from the relay's, so
 * nobody on the network can crowd out relay service; signed-in sessions keep the relay's limits.
