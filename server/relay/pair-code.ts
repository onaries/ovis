/**
 * The PC's side of pairing with a typed code (shared/relay-pair-code.ts, docs/relay.md "Pairing
 * with a typed code"). Minting a code starts a fresh six-digit pairing code, holds the code's
 * nameplate on the relay (relay/pair-room.ts) and answers each device that joins with one CPace
 * exchange. A device that knew the code gets the pairing offer the QR code shows, with that
 * six-digit code in it, and pairs with it as a scanned QR code does (DeviceStore.pairRelay): the
 * typed code only delivers the offer, it admits nobody.
 *
 * The tries are counted here, never by the relay: one is taken before M1 goes out and only a
 * correct confirmation ends the code (spent: single use); a wrong one, a malformed answer, a device
 * that leaves after M1 or one that runs out of time keeps the try spent, and the third ends the
 * code. A host socket that drops reopens on the same nameplate with the same tries left. M1 for the
 * next device is worked out ahead of time, so the relay cannot time it against a device's arrival.
