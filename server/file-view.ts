/**
 * Opening a file from the browser: the files agents write (a screenshot, a demo video, a
 * PDF, a log) seen on a phone that has no terminal to open them with.
 *
 * A file is served with Range answered (`byteRange`) and its content-length: a body of at most
 * one read (`STREAM_CHUNK_BYTES`) is read whole before its headers are sent; a larger one is sent
 * as a file, which Bun reads from disk as the client takes it, so a video plays and seeks without
 * the server holding more than its socket buffers. From a disk that answered slowly a larger body
 * is streamed from its descriptor instead, without a content-length (`file-tasks.ts` `open`). Only the first bytes of a file are
 * read, to tell text from binary. A rendered page's own files and the videos it plays are read
 * only from a descriptor whose opened file was shown to lie where the page may reach
 * (`openAuthorized`). Finding, describing, rendering and opening a file for `/api/fs/stat`,
 * `/api/fs/file` and `/api/fs/favicon` run on a file thread (`file-pool.ts`), so a slow disk or a
 * large page holds that thread, not the server's; a rendered page's media address
 * (`pageMediaResponse`) is still opened and checked on the server's thread.
 *
 * It opens what this server's user can read, which is no more than the terminal the same
 * browser can already type into.

 *   hidden name; a descriptor whose path cannot be read, or whose file was deleted, is refused.
 * - macOS: every folder from the root the file lies in down to its own folder must be a folder,
 *   not a link, owned by this server's user and writable by no group or other user, so only this
 *   user's own processes can swap them, and those can already read what a swap would expose. It
 *   is not a proof against this user's own processes.
 * - Windows: the second resolution and identity check only, and no look at the folders' access
 *   lists: anyone allowed to write to a folder on the way can race them. That is outside the one
 *   user this server serves.
 * - Anywhere else, nothing is authorized.
 * `hidden` lets a file with a hidden name below its root through too. `cell`: where a file thread
 * names the descriptor the moment it is open (`file-pool.ts`), so a thread ended mid-check leaves
 * none open; a refused one is taken back from it before it is closed. The caller reads only from
