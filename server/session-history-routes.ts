 * Claude listing asked for from a pane (`pane_id`) lists the store of that pane's Claude, found as
 * the live chat finds it (claude-store.ts paneClaudeSource), and binds each row's Resume to that
 * pane and store: POST /api/sessions/resume finds the store again, refuses one that changed, and
 * starts the session in it. A pane herdr reports processes for and no Claude among them has the
 * server's default store; one whose processes or store cannot be told gets an error, never the
 * default store. On Windows herdr names only the pane's shell, so its Claude is looked for under
 * `shell_pid` in the process table. A source with no CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR exported is bound only where
 * the environment a new tab inherits exports none either (claude-store.ts herdrLaunchSource).
