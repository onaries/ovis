/**
 * Installing herdr-core (`hc`) for a person who asked for it in Settings, the way its own installer
 * does (releases.herdr.dev/core/install.sh): the release archive for this PC, checked against its
 * SHA-256, then `herdr-core` copied into ~/.local/bin, with `hc` linked beside it only when no `hc`
 * is there. No sudo, and nothing of herdr's TUI is touched.
 *
 * Unlike that installer, the version and its checksums are pinned here (the desktop app carries the
 * same hc: app/electron/scripts/runtimes.ts), so a click never runs whatever the release server
 * hands out that day. Nothing already installed is replaced: a `herdr-core` in ~/.local/bin, even
 * one that does not answer, refuses the install. A failure leaves ~/.local/bin as it was.
