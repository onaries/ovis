/**
 * herdr's socket API, answered from herdr-core. The server talks to herdr through one client
 * (server/herdr/client.ts) whose callers read herdr's session snapshot, panes, screens and status
 * events; this adapter listens where that client connects (HERDR_SOCKET) and answers the methods a
 * terminal view needs from hc, so none of those callers learns a second runtime:
 *
 * - `ping`, `session.snapshot`, `pane.get`, `agent.get`, `pane.process_info` and `pane.read` from
 *   hc's terminal records, the app's layout document and `terminal.read`;
 * - `pane.send_text` as bytes typed into the terminal, over a short attach stream at the
 *   terminal's own grid (hc has no other way to type raw bytes, and a viewer at the current size
 *   resizes nothing);
 * - `pane.send_keys` as those keys' bytes in the same way, or hc's `terminal.keys` for a key that
 *   only hc can encode for the program's keyboard mode;
 * - `agent.prompt` as hc's `terminal.send` (paste and Enter, refused while the program is blocked);
 * - `events.subscribe` from hc's own event stream: status changes per pane, and terminal and layout
 *   changes as herdr's lifecycle events.
 *
 * On a core no Herdr app arranges (its document was never written: the desktop app's own core),
 * Ovis keeps names and a pane's workspace and tab in terminal labels, and the order of workspaces
 * and tabs, each tab's splits and its zoom in a document of its own, `ovis-layout`
 * (layout-doc.ts; `ping` says which in `layout`). Where the app arranges them, they are the app's.
 * hc has no worktrees: `worktree.*` runs git itself and opens a checkout as a workspace of its own
 * (worktrees.ts). Everything else (focus, plugins) is refused as `unsupported`.
 * The live terminal itself is `hc attach`, which the server
 * runs in place of `herdr terminal attach` (server/core/terminal-process.ts).
 *
 * As herdr does, each request has a connection of its own that ends with its answer; only an
 * events subscription stays open.
