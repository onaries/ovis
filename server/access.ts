/**
 * Who a request is and whether it gets in. There is no user database: a request is trusted
 * for where it comes from (this PC, with no proxy in front), for who Tailscale says it is
 * (the PC's own login, which `tailscale serve` states in a header it strips from what it
 * receives), or for what it holds (a paired device's cookie, or the shared token). A token,
 * when one is configured, is required of everything but a paired device, this PC and its own
 * Tailscale login included: a plain local connection, since the remote-PC bridge runs on a
 * loopback port of a PC other people may use, and the login, since any other proxy on this PC
 * (nginx, Caddy, a tunnel) passes a visitor's copy of that header on unless told to drop it.
 * Without a token, and until the first device is paired, anything that reaches the server is
 * let in as it always was, except through a proxy
 * on a PC whose Tailscale login is known: there, a request with no login header is a tagged
 * node (tailscale serve states no person for it), and a tailnet can hold many of those. The
 * exception is an install whose operator declared `tailscale serve` the only way in
 * (OVIS_TAILSCALE_SERVE_ONLY) on a tailnet Tailscale says holds no tagged node and no second
 * login: no stranger exists there to be mistaken for, so a serve-proxied request with no login is
 * the owner, and the owner's own phone opens the address without a code. On that path, and only
 * there, the request's Host must name this PC's own Tailscale name or address: `tailscale serve`
 * passes the client's Host through, and under the declaration no other ingress exists to forge it
 * through, while a rebinding page can only ever present its own origin.
 * A PC whose own node is tagged has no login to compare with: its proxied requests pair, the
 * owner's included, unless OVIS_TAILSCALE_OWNER names the login to let in.
 *
 * A proxy on this PC connects from loopback like a local client does, so it is known only by
 * what it sends: a forwarding header, or a Host that is not a name for this machine. A proxy
 * that sends neither (nginx's bare `proxy_pass` rewrites Host to the upstream address and adds
 * nothing) cannot be told from a local client: only a token closes that setup.
 *
 * Portal's own sign-in (a private link, an Ethereum wallet, an OIDC account) is one more way in,
 * and the one exception to "a token is required of everything but a paired device": a visitor it let
 * in may watch by default, with no token asked. The owner's app token and paired-device role still
 * take precedence; a Portal identity alone does not identify the owner. Invites store their role
 * server-side, never in a visitor-supplied header. Its X-Portal-User and
 * X-Portal-Auth are believed only with the proof Portal sends beside them (`portalLogin`).
