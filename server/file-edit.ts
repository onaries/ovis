/**
 * Editing a text file from the file viewer (#771): a Markdown note or a JSON file an agent wrote,
 * changed from a phone with no terminal to open an editor in. Reading a file reaches whatever this
 * server's user can read (file-view.ts); writing reaches less: one existing text file under the
 * pane's folder, for a device that drives this PC (`textEditAllowed`).
 *
 * A save is written to a new file in the same folder, given the file's mode and group, and renamed
 * over it, so a reader sees the old text or the new, never half of it. What is replaced must be the
 * file that was read: its SHA-256 (`revision`) is checked once before the new file is written and
 * again right before the rename, and a file changed since it was read is not written (409). On
 * Linux every step after the file was proven to lie in the pane's folder goes through a descriptor
 * of its folder (`/proc/self/fd/N/<name>`), so a folder on the way swapped for a link meanwhile
 * cannot send the rename anywhere else; on macOS the folders from the pane's folder down must be
 * this user's own and writable by nobody else (`ownedFolders`), checked right before the rename.
 * Other platforms do not save yet. The file's extended attributes and access list are carried over
 * to the new file (file-attributes.ts); one whose access list cannot be is not saved. A read runs on a file thread (`file-pool.ts` `text-read`). A save
 * runs on the server's own thread, synchronously: two saves never interleave, and a save is over
 * when it is answered, never still running after a timeout. It is at most 1 MiB written to the
 * disk the file was just read from; a disk that stalls during it holds the server for that long.
