 * tabs behind cost, usage, stats and status, help, memory, sandbox, tasks and the rest down to
 * passes; add-dir and cd still ask to confirm a path given with them. The account, cloud and setup
 * flows a signed-out session cannot open render the same kind of screen in their own definition.
 * The last group answers only on the PC itself: diff's side panel, ide, copy's clipboard, voice,
 * keybindings' editor, stickers and radio.
