 * Anonymous install and update counts (shared/telemetry.ts). One event when an install first

 * a browser visits, naming the kinds of coding agents running then and the day's usage (the
 * kinds of screen and ways in of its visits, and its prompt answers and pane alerts counted by
 * `tally`, both only once the current notice was shown); a later visit that day resends it when a
 * new kind of agent appeared, or the usage changed and USAGE_RESEND_MS passed since it last went
 * (an earlier resend carries the usage already sent). No event or message goes out before the app has
 * shown its notice once, while the switch is off, or where the environment says not to.
 * Events include the latest browser's schema-validated settings snapshot; free-form strings and
 * account identifiers are summarized or omitted by the browser's projection.
 * Only the real entrypoint (index.ts) makes one of these, so tests and a remote PC's bridge
