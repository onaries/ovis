/**
 * Test support, never served: a file thread (`file-worker.ts`) whose tasks can be held. It runs
 * each task for real, then
 * - never answers a task whose path ends in `/stuck`, nor an `open` of one ending in `/held-open`
 *   (its stat answers), as a call that never returns would not;
 * - with a `gate` (a SharedArrayBuffer of two Int32 cells), records in cell 1 the descriptor the
 *   task opened (`Atomics.notify` on it; -2 when it opened none) and answers only once cell 0 is
 *   set, as a call that returns late would;
 * - with a `readGate` (three Int32 cells and a FIFO's path), stops inside the file read itself: it
 *   opens the FIFO (read and write, which never waits), records the descriptor being read in cell 1
 *   (`Atomics.notify`), then blocks in a read of the FIFO, a real system call that ending the thread
 *   cannot cut short, and then reads the file, as a read on a stalled disk would. Opened before
 *   cell 1 is set, the FIFO always has this reader once the test sees it, so the test's release (a
 *   write that does not wait) never waits for this thread, even one ended in the meantime;
 * - with an `authorizeGate` (the same shape), stops once the file is authorized, before the task
 *   answers, as a check on a stalled disk would: it opens the FIFO (read and write, which never
 *   waits), records the descriptor the task named in its cell (`opened`) in cell 1, then blocks in a
 *   read of the FIFO. Opened before cell 1 is set, the FIFO always has this reader once the test
 *   sees it, so the test's release (a write that does not wait) never waits for this thread.
 *
 * Both FIFO gates name their FIFO descriptor in cell 2: a thread ended inside its read never runs its
 * `finally` (Bun stops it as the read returns), so the test closes that descriptor once the thread
 * is gone. Whichever side takes it from the cell first (`Atomics.exchange`) closes it.
