/**
 * The status of a GJC pane, read from gjc's own transcript.
 *
 * herdr follows the pane's provider child, not the gjc parent: a turn gjc finished keeps
 * reading `working` for what the child does, and the sidebar holds RUN with no done alert.
 * The transcript the pane's gjc extension reports (gjc-runtime.ts finds exactly that file, never a
 * newest file by cwd) tells the parent turn instead: a user prompt, a tool result or an
 * assistant message that stopped for a tool means work; one that stopped for good (`stop`,
 * `length`) is rest, and one that errored or was aborted is rest after a failure — READY, not
 * DONE (#687's rule holds here too). gjc wakes the agent with a custom message when work it
 * asked for lands elsewhere — a background job's `async-result`, a monitor's
 * `task-notification`, a timer's `cron-fire` — displayed or not: that begins a new parent
 * turn. Everything else gjc writes (custom bookkeeping, model notices) is no turn's business.
 * A tool call named `ask` holds a question for the user open until its result arrives, an
 * error result included: while one is open the pane reads INPUT, whatever the turn does.
 *
 * The status replaces herdr's for the pane only once a turn record was actually read and the
 * read is current: an empty, missing, unreadable or half-written transcript proves nothing,
 * so herdr's `working` stands rather than a rest no one saw. The machinery is omo-status.ts's,
 * composed with the `gjc` identity and this file's reducer; gjc keeps no background-task
 * records to count. A turn the process holding the session now could not have run (it started
 * after the record was written) is another process's unfinished work: an interruption, told as
 * a failed rest, never a finish.
