/**
 * Paired devices: the per-device credential a phone (or anyone the owner lets in) uses
 * instead of the shared token. The owner starts a pairing on the PC and gets a short code
 * that lives ten minutes; the device sends the code once and receives a token of its own
 * in an HttpOnly cookie. Only a hash of that token is stored, so devices.json in the state
 * dir (0600, written whole, and flushed before it replaces the old list whenever access
 * changes: private-state.ts) reveals nothing if read. Revocation also closes that device's
 * active streams; revoking all is one write of an empty, gated registry, after which every
 * credential (paired, pending or unconfirmed) is void. A device is either allowed to drive
 * (type, answer, manage) or only to watch. A durable enrollment is announced (`onPaired`) once
 * its write succeeded, so every other session can hear of a device it did not pair.
