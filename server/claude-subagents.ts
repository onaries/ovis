/**
 * The subagents one Claude Code session started (the `Agent` tool), for the status line's list,
 * the pane's running count and the chat's result cards. Claude keeps, beside the session's
 * transcript `<project>/<session>.jsonl`, a folder `<session>/subagents/` with one pair per
 * subagent: `agent-<id>.meta.json` (description, agent type, the tool call that started it) and
 * `agent-<id>.jsonl`, its own transcript. Whether it ended is told only by the parent
 * transcript: a background subagent by the `<task-notification>` Claude queues when it stops (a
 * teammate of an agent team gets none, and one's notice may not be written yet: its own file
 * ending in an `end_turn` answer or in the answer approving its lead's shutdown request, with
 * no message to it after, says it stopped), a synchronous one by the tool_result of its call
 * (the "Async agent launched" acknowledgement of a background call is no answer).
 *
 * A notification is carried up to three times (a user entry, a queue-operation, a queued_command
 * attachment) and the same agent notifies again each time it is resumed, so notices are kept per
 * agent, the newest of notice and answer wins, and an agent whose own file has entries newer than
 * that was resumed and is running again. A running agent lives inside the Claude process that
 * started it: one last written before the process now in the pane started is lost.
 *
 * Reading is cheap enough to run every few seconds per Claude pane: the parent transcript and
 * each subagent file are read only from where the last read stopped, at most READ_BUDGET bytes
 * per file per call (the first read of a parent covers its last PARENT_WINDOW bytes); a file whose
 * size did not change is not opened; the folder listing is kept until the folder changes; only
 * files touched in the last day are looked at, at most MAX_AGENTS of them; only plain files are
 * read; ids that become paths are plain words. Prompts and answers stay here.
 *
 * `tokens` is the total Claude's own footer shows for a subagent: what its last request held,
 * input + cache read + cache creation + output tokens of the last assistant entry (checked
 * against `totalTokens` in the tool result of a finished agent). Summing every entry instead
 * would count the cached context again on each turn.
 *
 * Background commands are listed with them, as Claude Code's footer counts both: a `Bash` call
 * whose answer carries a `backgroundTaskId` (`run_in_background`, Ctrl+B, or a call moved there
 * when it ran past its timeout), by the session or by a subagent. One ends with the
 * `<task-notification>` of its task id, in any transcript of the session, or with the answer
 * of the `TaskStop` (`KillShell` in older Claude Code) that stopped it, which no notice follows.
 * It lives in the Claude process that started it, as a running agent does.

 * carries no prompt or tool argument; this reads one agent's two files once, on request, and
 * keeps nothing. Bounded: the meta file at MAX_META_BYTES, the transcript at
 * DETAIL_LIMITS.max_read_bytes in all, in two reads that never overlap (its first
 * DETAIL_HEAD_BYTES, where the dispatch prompt is, and its last DETAIL_TAIL_BYTES, the recent
 * activity, the byte before which says whether the window starts a record), a record at
 * DETAIL_RECORD_BYTES, the answer at DETAIL_LIMITS.max_events events and max_output_bytes of text.
 * A record a window cuts, one over its size and a line that is no record are skipped and said
 * (`incomplete`), never guessed at: a dispatch that cannot be read is no prompt, and a later
 * instruction is not taken for it. What the windows left out, the events dropped for the cap and
 * the text left out for its budget are said (`truncated`). Only the prompt the agent was
 * dispatched with, its prose and its tool calls (name and arguments) are read: no tool result,
 * no thinking, no image, nothing from a screen.
 *
 * The files are `<store>/<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.meta.json` and `agent-<id>.jsonl`, the
 * store being the real folder of the session's own transcript. The id is a plain word of at most
 * DETAIL_ID_LENGTH, so it names nothing outside that folder. Each folder on the way is a folder
 * and no link, looked at before the files are opened and again after they are read, and must be
 * the same folder both times. Where the kernel names an open descriptor's file (Linux's
 * /proc/self/fd), the subagents folder is opened itself and the files are opened inside that open
 * folder, and each descriptor's own path must be the one expected: a folder on the way swapped for
 * a link, or moved away, between the look and the read, is refused, whatever was opened. Elsewhere
 * the looks before and after stand for it. A file is opened only as a plain file that is no link,
 * and the descriptor read is checked to be the file that was looked at.
 *
 * A file there is the agent's only when it says so: its meta file names an agent type, and every
 * record of its transcript is a sidechain's of this session and of this agent (Claude Code writes
 * `isSidechain`, `sessionId` and `agentId` on each). A file that says otherwise is no agent of the
 * session's; nothing of it is answered.
