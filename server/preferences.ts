 * the whole document from the event. A change is held, and told, only once it is on disk.
 * The muted panes are always in the document, empty while nothing is muted: a server with none
 * stored reads as none muted, without a write or a new revision, so a browser tells a server that
 * keeps the list from an older one by the list being there. They are stored in a document of their
 * own, muted-panes.json, not in preferences.json: a release from before them rewrites
 * preferences.json whole on its next save (a rollback, a downgrade), and would erase a list kept
 * there. preferences.json keeps the shape every release reads and writes. The tab labels
 * (`tab_labels`) are kept apart in tab-labels.json for the same reason; they are only ever added
 * (mergeTabLabels), and are absent from the document while none is kept.
