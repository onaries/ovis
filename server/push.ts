/**
 * Web Push: pane alerts that reach a device even when Ovis is closed there.
 *
 * The browser hands us a subscription (an endpoint on its vendor's push service plus
 * the keys to encrypt for it); we POST encrypted payloads there, signed with our VAPID
 * key. Both halves persist in the state dir (default ~/.config/ovis):
 * - vapid.json: every subscription is bound to this key pair. Regenerating it silently
 *   orphans every subscribed device, so a malformed file is an error, never a rotation.
 * - push-subscriptions.json: survives restarts, so a reboot does not unsubscribe phones.
 *   A 404/410 from a push service means the device dropped it; the record is deleted.
 * - push-retired.json: the endpoint is also remembered, as a hash with the owner it was retired for
 *   (`RETIRED_LIMIT`), so a restart does not forget it and a revocation finds it: a browser can keep handing over a subscription its push
 *   service retired, and registering it again would only fail the next push, so it is refused as
 *   `subscription_gone` and the device subscribes anew (#1038). A mark has no time limit: one that
 *   expired would let any device that knows the endpoint register it as its own (#2012). Only its
 *   owner's revocation removes it, or a thousand later retirements.
 * - push-keys.json (PUSH_EXTRA_KEYS): key pairs other than vapid.json's, each with the endpoints
 *   made for it. Only state-merge.ts writes it, for subscriptions taken over from the other state
 *   dir of an install that had two: each is signed with the key it was made for until its device
 *   subscribes again with this server's key (src/lib/push.ts does when it next opens).
 * - push-delivery.json: how the last push to each subscription went (`last_success_at`,
 *   `last_failure_at`, `last_failure`), by endpoint hash, with the owner and a hash of the keys it
 *   was recorded for. A device reads its own record through POST /api/push/status once it proves
 *   both, so a subscription its push service retired can still say why alerts stopped (#1039).
 *   Bounded like the retired list, and expired (`DELIVERY_TTL_MS`) on every read and write; an explicit unsubscribe or
 *   the device's revocation removes it together with the endpoint's retired mark.
 *
 * Requests are built by web-push's generateRequestDetails (RFC 8291 aes128gcm + RFC
 * 8292 VAPID) and sent with fetch; its sendNotification path goes through node:https
 * and https-proxy-agent, which Bun does not need.
 *
 * An alert waits before it goes out, and a change of the pane's status meanwhile calls it
 * off: a question answered at the desk, or a finish followed by the next prompt, never
 * reaches the phone. herdr says nothing of whether anyone is at the PC, so a change that
 * quick is taken for someone being there (as Claude Code waits ~6 s on a permission
 * prompt and ~60 s after a reply before it notifies). A question waits `short`; a finish
 * waits `long`, and only one after a turn that worked `longTurn` or more is worth it,
 * unless the device asked for every finish (which then waits `short`).
 *
 * No device gets an alert while a window of the app is in use somewhere (`inUse`: a
 * connected page that is visible and has focus, which says so over its WebSocket): the
 * person is at a screen that already shows the change (#751). It is asked when an alert
 * would go out, so a window brought forward while the alert waits still holds it back.
 *
 * A pane on the shared mute list (`muted`, shared/preferences.ts `muted_panes`) gets no alert
 * on any device: none is scheduled for it, one already waiting is called off when the list
 * changes (`mutesChanged`), and the list is asked again right before a waiting one goes out.
 * Its status is tracked all the same, so an unmute tells only what changes after it.
