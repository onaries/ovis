/**
 * Which Letta Code conversation a pane shows. These facts must agree, or Chat uses Terminal:
 * - herdr's report from its Letta integration (`herdr integration install letta`), when there is one:
 *   `herdr:letta`,
 *   the conversation id, or `default:<agent id>` for an agent's default conversation. herdr 0.9.5
 *   keeps the first report of a letta process, so after `/new` or `/resume` it still names the
 *   conversation the pane left.
 * - Letta's own record of the conversation it opened, which every letta process writes into its
 *   project's `.letta/settings.local.json` (`sessionsByServer`) on start and on every switch, and
 *   reads back to resume. It is shared by every letta in that folder, and nothing in it says which
 *   process wrote it, so it speaks for the pane's process only when it is older than that process:
 *   a letta that opens the conversation the record names writes nothing (`setLocalLastSession`
 *   skips an equal session), and any later write (a `/new` or `/resume`, its own start on another
 *   conversation, or another letta, even one gone since) leaves Chat on Terminal until letta starts again.
 * - The pane's one letta process: its own environment for where Letta keeps its files
 *   (`LETTA_CONFIG_DIR`, `LETTA_TRANSCRIPT_ROOT`, `HOME`), read from the process on Linux and macOS
 *   (Windows has no such read, and uses Terminal), and the folder it started in (lettaInStartFolder),
 *   whose record is the only one read, while the process is still there.
 * The transcript must then be a regular file at exactly the path Letta derives from the two ids.
 *
 * herdr-core sends no report for Letta, and herdr none without the integration. Then nothing backs the
 * record but its own age, so more must hold (lettaRecordSpeaksAlone): the letta was started plainly,
 * which resumes the record's conversation; it saves its sessions; no other Letta pane goes unreported;
 * and the transcript was written since the process started, the process's own use of it.
