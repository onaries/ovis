/**
 * An install from before 0.4.16 could keep its state in two dirs: a fresh 0.4.14 or 0.4.15 install
 * kept it under the new name (ovis) until its next restart, its first update included, which took
 * the old one (herdr-web-ui) because the bridge registry is created there (update-state.ts). Each
 * dir may then hold paired devices, shared preferences and push subscriptions the other lacks. A
 * server whose state dir is one of the two takes over the other's before any store reads them.
 *
 * Paired devices (devices.json) are an authorization record, so both dirs end with the same one:
 * a release before this one that ever reads either finds every device and a closed gate. Devices are
 * merged by id against the ids both held after the last merge (state-merge.json, kept in both dirs):
 * one only one side holds is new there and is kept, unless the last merge had it, which means it was
 * revoked on the other side since, and it stays revoked. The first merge has nothing to compare with
 * and keeps every device. The gate is closed from the earliest evidence either side holds, so a merge
 * never opens it. A registry or merge record that cannot be read fails closed: the store stays gated
 * and pairs nothing (devices.ts), neither registry is written, and a dir without a registry gets a
 * closed, empty one marked incomplete: its missing devices are never read as revoked.
 *
 * Preferences and mutes, too, end alike in both dirs. Each merge starts from what the last one
 * settled on and lays over it what each dir changed since (against what that dir held after the last
 * merge); where both changed a setting, the preferences document written last wins. Mutes take each
 * dir's additions and removals. The first merge keeps this dir's, the other's where this one has none
 * or wrote longer ago, and the union of the mutes. Push subscriptions go to the
 * dir in use only, each taken over once, with the key pair it was made for (push.ts PUSH_EXTRA_KEYS).
 *
 * Nothing is deleted: a file about to be replaced is first copied to `state-merge-backups/<time>/`
 * in its own dir. Every write replaces a whole file atomically and the merge only adds what one side
 * holds or removes what one side dropped since the last merge, so a merge stopped at any point
 * (a crash, a power loss) merges the same way at the next start.
