 * A lease has at most two native operations in flight, the one it awaits and a read ahead, so the
 * reader has at most twice its capacity of them.
 *
 * On a local Linux filesystem (LOCAL) a lease opens, stats, reads and closes on the event loop
 * instead, with no read ahead, while each call is fast. A lease that has to look up its

 * SLOW_MS sends the rest of the lease through the thread pool, and the transcript's leases for SLOW_FOR_MS (one alone
 * may be a garbage collection, not the disk). Every
 * other filesystem and platform reads through the thread pool only.
 *
 * Known limits:
 * - A local disk that stops answering inside a call on the event loop blocks the loop, as a
 *   synchronous read would. The fallback notices a slow call only once it returns.
 * - A native operation that never settles (a read ahead or any other) keeps its lease, so two of
 *   them on two paths keep every lease, and every later read waits out its deadline (one with a
 *   budget alone waits until its signal aborts).
 * - A cancelled lease keeps its path too, until its operations settle: a new read of that
