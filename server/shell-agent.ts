 * A Windows pane differs in three ways, each live-verified on a Windows PC (herdr 0.9.3):
 * - its shell is PowerShell or cmd: a quoted path alone is a string there, not a call;
 * - a newline in sent text is a line break in PowerShell's editor (it waits at `>>`): the
 *   command is run by the Enter key;
 * - process_info names only the shell, so the shell's children say whether the agent runs.
