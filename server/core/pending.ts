/**
 * Messages a connection sends to wait for the agent: queued for its next turn, or held for the
 * sender's Send now. Each carries a lease on the pane's terminal and on the sender's authority,
 * checked again before every write, so a message is typed only into the attach it was sent from
 * while that connection may still type. A turn's end sends the pane's next message; losing the
 * lease holds it for the sender to review instead of sending it.
 *
 * A create request's first message (POST /api/workspace/create and /api/tab/create `first_message`)
 * is listed by the bridge (FIRST_MESSAGE_OWNER), so every connection attached to the pane sees it among
 * its pending messages and may discard or send it now; one pane holds one. It is typed on its own only
 * through the page connection that sent the request (`first_message_connection`), while that connection
 * has the pane attached, with the same checks as its own queued messages. Once that connection closes
 * or leaves the pane before it went, or when the request named none, it is held: nothing the user typed
 * goes automatically after a disconnect, another device attaching later never types it on its own, and
 * the pane's other messages are not left behind it. It is bound to the agent the launch brought up: the
 * process and session in front when it is queued, and what herdr says of that agent at each event of the
 * pane after, so another session or process of the same kind gets none.
 * First messages live in memory: a restart of the bridge loses those not sent yet.
