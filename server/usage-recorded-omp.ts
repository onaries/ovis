 * Claude's limits as Oh My Pi recorded them. While it runs, Oh My Pi reads the limits of each account it is signed

 * (as Oh My Pi 18.14 to 18.19 write it, packages/ai/src/auth/sqlite-credential-store.ts):
 *   recorded_at    epoch ms the report was read; the rows of one report share it
 *   provider       "anthropic" for Claude
 *   account_key    Oh My Pi's own name for the sign-in the report was read with
 *   account_id     the Claude account's uuid, the id Claude Code's .claude.json names too
 *   email
 *   limit_id       "anthropic:5h", "anthropic:7d", "anthropic:7d:<model>", "anthropic:extra"
 *   label          "Claude 7 Day (Fable)"
 *   used_fraction  0 to 1; null when the provider stated none
 *   resets_at      epoch ms; null when the provider stated none
 *
 * That table is all this reads. The same file holds Oh My Pi's sign-ins (`auth_credentials`): nothing here names
 * that table, and the file is only read.
