/**
 * The files an ssh config's Include lines name, read for the SSH tab's list (server/ssh-candidates.ts): only what
 * really is inside the home or ssh folder, within one budget of files, bytes, folder entries and matching work per
 * config. A file or folder is opened first and what was opened is checked, so nothing swapped in on the way after a
 * check stands in for it: Linux names the opened object itself (/proc/self/fd); elsewhere a file's path is resolved
 * again once open and must still name the same object. With glibc a folder is listed through its open descriptor
 * (getdents64), a bounded read at a time, and what it matched is opened relative to that folder, still held (openat:
 * server/ssh-include-dir.ts). Without them (macOS, Windows, a Linux without glibc) Bun has no descriptor-relative
 * listing, so a wildcard's folders are listed by path, which a swap after the check can redirect. Such a listing only
 * gives names: a name from a folder out of home can be listed (its file is still opened and checked), and a file can be
 * hidden. So every file reached that way comes back marked `unclaimed` (its hosts are listed but claim no Tailscale
 * PC), and the Include also leaves the unread marker after them, whatever the listing found, so no host whose options
 * were still unset there (any host after it) claims one either.
