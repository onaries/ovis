/**
 * A Claude Code turn that ended while work it started still runs in the background: a subagent,
 * or a command (a test suite, a build). herdr reads that pane as at rest, `done` while unseen,
 * and the work's notice will start the next turn by itself, with no prompt: the pane reads DONE
 * and alerts "work finished" while the work goes on. Live, herdr reads that next turn as
 * `working` about 2 s after the work ended.
 *
 * So a pane at rest whose turn's work runs, or ended less than WAIT_GRACE_MS ago, is waiting:
 * the sidebar says so in place of DONE, and the alerts take it for working (`alertStatus`,
 * shared/notify-policy.ts), so a turn that goes on is one turn, alerted once when it ends. Work
 * that ended before the turn did holds nothing. The limit starts at the first rest after the
 * person's prompt, not at each automatic resume. A resting baseline starts no hold.
 *
 * An OmO pane is held the same way (index.ts `omoChanged`), on the count of its session's pending
 * and running tasks: OmO's records name the session, not the turn, that started a task. It is held
 * as long as one runs, with no WAIT_LIMIT_MS: a task whose host process died is not counted
 * (omo-status.ts), and OmO wakes the session when a task ends.
