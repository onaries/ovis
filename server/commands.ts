 * starting another, and if it finishes after everyone waiting gave up, the next request for it
 * takes that answer (within `UNCLAIMED_SCAN_MS`), so a scan slower than one request's wait still
 * answers. A scan still waiting for a thread when its last request leaves is dropped, so it holds
 * no waiting place. An answer a request received is not kept: the next request scans again, and
