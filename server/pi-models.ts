/**
 * The context window a pi model runs in.
 *
 * A pi transcript records what a request filled but never the window it filled, so the
 * percentage the composer's ring shows cannot come from the file. pi answers it from its
 * own model registry, which lives in the process (`getBuiltinModel`, compiled into the
 * bundle) and is refreshed over the network, so a reader of the transcript cannot duplicate
 * it. What it can read are the catalogs pi does keep on disk:
 *
 *  - `models.json` — the user's custom providers (pi's default location, moved by
 *    `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`), the only file pi's own footer consults;
 *  - `commandcode-models.json` — the commandcode provider's cached catalog, which states a
 *    window for every model pi offers through it;
 *  - `models-store.json` — pi's store for the other providers it knows on disk, by provider
 *    id, each with the same flat `models` list.
 *
 * So this resolves what those files state and nothing else. A model pi knows only from its
 * built-in registry, a provider whose entry omits `contextWindow`, and a model that names none
 * while its provider states one (pi does not inherit that number) all stay unresolved and the
 * ring is not drawn: guessing a window would draw a percentage the user cannot tell from pi's
 * own. pi's footer does the same, showing `?` in place of a number.

/**
 * A `models.json` provider's models by id.
 *
 * A model's own `contextWindow`, or the `modelOverrides[model.id]` window when pi has one, and
 * nothing else. Two things this deliberately does not do, both checked against pi 0.87.1 by
 * pointing `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` at a crafted `models.json` and reading `pi --list-models`:
 *
 * - A provider-level `contextWindow` is NOT inherited by its models. A provider at 32000 whose
 *   model names no window shows that model at pi's own default of 128000, not at 32000. So this
 *   reports no window there: pi's default is pi's to apply, not a number this reader may show as
 *   though the user had stated it, and the ring stays undrawn rather than showing a denominator pi
 *   never used.
 * - `modelOverrides` IS applied, after the model definitions, and wins
 *   (`contextWindow: override.contextWindow ?? model.contextWindow`). Reading only `models` would
 *   report the pre-override window; at 128000 against an override of 256000 that is half the window
 *   and double the percentage the ring shows.
 *
 * An entry that is not an object is skipped rather than read, and the models beside it are still
 * resolved. pi is stricter: it validates the file, warns, and refuses the whole provider — checked
 * with a `models` list of `null, "a string", {id}`, which leaves `pi --list-models` reporting no
 * models at all. This reader is deliberately the more forgiving of the two, because its worst
 * outcome is one fewer number on the ring, while pi's worst outcome is switching to a model that
 * does not exist. It is not merely defensive: a `null` in that list threw, and the throw came from
 * the read every poll does, so the chat went down for a comma in a hand-edited file.
