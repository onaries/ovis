# App Store: TestFlight, then review

Everything for the first App Store release of the iOS app that does not need the owner's Apple
login: what the project already sets, the clicks in Apple's sites, the listing, the privacy and
age answers, and the review notes. Screenshots are in `app/store/ios/`.

The first release has no push notifications (they need an APNs key and the Notification Service
Extension, a later build; see [Later builds](#later-builds)).

## 1. What the project sets

| Setting | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Bundle ID | `sh.ovis.app` | `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, `app/ios/App/App.xcodeproj` |
| Version | `1.0` | `MARKETING_VERSION`, in the project's build settings, which the app and its extension share (not a target's General tab) |
| Build | `1` | `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`, in the project's build settings too; raise it by one for every upload, TestFlight included |
| Devices | iPhone and iPad | `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"`, so the listing needs iPad screenshots too |
| Minimum iOS | 15.0 | `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` |
| Signing | Automatic, no team yet | the owner picks the team in Xcode (section 3) |
| Camera text | "Scan the QR code your PC shows under Settings, Phone & devices." | `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `Info.plist` |
| Microphone text | "Dictate messages and commands to your agents with voice input." | `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `Info.plist` |
| Export compliance | no non-exempt encryption (only Apple's HTTPS) | `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false`, so uploads skip the question |
| Privacy manifest | no tracking; product interaction, device ID and coarse location collected for analytics, linked to the PC's install ID, not tracking (the PC's usage counts, section 5); UserDefaults for the app's own settings (reason `CA92.1`) | `app/ios/App/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` |

## 2. Apple's sites, click by click (the owner)

1. **App ID**: developer.apple.com > Account > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Identifiers
   > + > App IDs > App. Description `Ovis`, Bundle ID Explicit `sh.ovis.app`. No capabilities
   for now (Push Notifications comes with the push build). Continue, Register.
2. **App record**: appstoreconnect.apple.com > Apps > + > New App. Platform iOS, Name
   `Ovis for herdr` (if Apple says the name is taken, try `Ovis - herdr on your phone`), Primary
   language English (U.S.), Bundle ID `sh.ovis.app`, SKU `ovis-ios`, User access Full Access.
3. **API key** (only if uploads should run from the command line instead of Xcode): App Store
   Connect > Users and Access > Integrations > App Store Connect API > Team Keys > +, name
   `ovis-upload`, access App Manager. Download the `.p8` once and keep it with the Key ID and
   Issuer ID in your password manager; it never goes into the repository. Xcode's own upload
   needs no key.

## 3. Build and upload (the owner, on his Mac with Xcode)

```bash
git switch main && git pull
bun install && cd app && bun install && bun run sync   # build:web, then cap sync ios
bun run open                                            # Xcode
```

In Xcode: target App > Signing & Capabilities > Team: your team (Automatically manage signing
stays on). Destination Any iOS Device (arm64). Product > Archive. When the Organizer opens:
Distribute App > App Store Connect > Upload, keep the defaults, Upload.

The build shows under App Store Connect > the app > TestFlight after Apple processes it (minutes
to an hour). Internal testing (you and up to 100 people on your team) needs no review; external
testers need a short beta review.

## 4. Store listing (App Store Connect > the app > App Store > iOS App 1.0)

**Name** (30 at most): `Ovis for herdr`

**Subtitle** (30 at most): `herdr agents on your phone`

**Promotional text** (170 at most):

> See and steer the coding agents on your PC from your phone: read their conversations, answer
> their questions, type into their terminals.

**Description:**

> Ovis puts the herdr terminal multiplexer on your phone. See every coding agent running on your
> PC, read its conversation, answer its questions and type into its terminal.
>
> How it works:
> - Install Ovis on your PC (ovis.sh) and open it there.
> - In the app, scan the pairing QR code from Settings > Phone & devices on the PC, or type its
>   address.
> - The app connects only to your own PC, over Tailscale or your own network.
>
> No account, no ads, no tracking. Try the demo on the first screen to look around without a PC.
>
> Ovis is open source: https://github.com/devswha/ovis

A Korean localization can be added later (App Store Connect > the app > App Information >
Localizable Information).

**Screenshots** (in `app/store/ios/`, from the iOS simulator: the connect screen and the
bundled demo, no real PC):

| Display | Files | Size | Simulator |
|---|---|---|---|
| iPhone 6.9" | `iphone-1-connect.png`, `iphone-2-chat.png`, `iphone-3-workspaces.png` | 1320 x 2868 | iPhone 18 Pro Max, iOS 27 |
| iPad 13" | `ipad-1-connect.png`, `ipad-2-chat.png` | 2064 x 2752 | iPad Pro 13-inch (M5), iOS 27 |

App Store Connect scales these down for the smaller displays it asks about. All are RGB PNGs
without transparency, with the status bar set to 9:41.

## 5. App Privacy (App Store Connect > the app > App Privacy)

Apple counts data as collected when it leaves the device "in a way that allows you and/or your
third-party partners to access it". What the app shows and sends goes only to a computer the
user runs, so it is not collected in Apple's sense. One route does reach the developer: the app
tells the PC the settings chosen in it (`TelemetryNotice` in
`src/components/TelemetryControls.tsx`), and the Ovis server on the PC puts the settings of the
last browser or phone that opened it into its anonymous usage counts, which it sends to the
developer's telemetry Worker (`server/telemetry.ts`, stored by `telemetry/worker.ts`). They are on
by default (opt-out), start only after the client has shown its notice, and stop when turned off
under Settings > About > Anonymous usage counts (in the app or on the PC), or with
`OVIS_TELEMETRY=0` on the PC. They hold a random ID made on the PC, the Ovis version, the PC's
operating system, CPU and install method, the allowlisted settings snapshot (no free-form text,
paths or account names), the kinds of coding agents running, and the country the receiver reads
from the PC's address (the address is not stored).

Get Started > *Do you or your third-party partners collect data from this app?* **Yes, we collect
data from this app.** Then declare:

| Data type | Use | Linked to the user | Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Usage Data > Product Interaction (the settings chosen in the app, and daily use) | Analytics | Yes | No |
| Identifiers > Device ID (the random install ID the PC makes) | Analytics | Yes | No |
| Location > Coarse Location (the country, two letters) | Analytics | Yes | No |

They count as linked: Apple's definition covers data tied to a device-level identifier, and the
receiver stores them with the PC's persistent install ID (random, with no account, name or contact
behind it). None is used for tracking: nothing is combined with other companies' data or shared
with data brokers or advertisers. The privacy manifest lists the same three types, and
`https://ovis.sh/privacy/` describes the same route. Privacy policy URL:
`https://ovis.sh/privacy/`.

## 6. Age rating (App Information > Age Rating > Edit)

Every content question: None. Contests: No. Gambling: No. Loot boxes: No. User-generated content
shared with other users: No. Messaging or chat with other users: No. **Unrestricted web access:
Yes**: the connect screen takes any http or https address and opens it in the app's web view, so
a user can open any website, which is what Apple's definition covers ("users can navigate to any
webpage within the app"). Apple then rates the app **16+**. (Only links inside the opened page
that lead elsewhere go to Safari.) If a lower rating ever matters, the app would first have to
refuse addresses that are not an Ovis server, which is an app change, not a form answer.

## 7. App Review information (version page > App Review Information)

- Sign-in required: **No** (no account exists).
- Contact: your name, phone and email.
- Notes:

> Ovis is the phone app for Ovis, an open-source program people run on their own computer to
> watch and control their coding agents and terminals (https://ovis.sh). The app connects only
> to the user's own computer, so there is no account to give you. To review the whole app without
> a computer, tap "Try the demo" on the first screen: it runs the full interface with made-up
> agents and terminals, entirely on the phone. "Scan QR code" uses the camera only to read the
> pairing code a computer shows. The app uses the microphone for voice input the user chooses:
> turning Voice input on in Settings briefly opens it to ask for access; the mic button or the
> keyboard shortcut starts dictation.

## 8. Release checklist

- [ ] App ID `sh.ovis.app` registered (section 2.1)
- [ ] App record made (2.2)
- [ ] Team set in Xcode, build number raised if this is not the first upload
- [ ] Archive uploaded, build processed, tried in TestFlight on a phone
- [ ] Listing texts, URLs, category, screenshots (iPhone and iPad) filled in
- [ ] App Privacy published (the three types in section 5)
- [ ] Age rating answered
- [ ] Review notes and contact filled in
- [ ] Build selected on the version page > Add for Review > Submit

Apple may ask about guideline 4.2 (an app that is "mostly a website"): the answer is the native
connect screen, QR pairing, the bundled demo, and push notifications in a coming version.

## Later builds

- **Push (APNs)**: an APNs auth key (developer.apple.com > Keys > + > Apple Push Notifications
  service) for the relay, the Push Notifications capability on `sh.ovis.app`, and the
  Notification Service Extension target. The App Privacy answer changes then: the device's push
  token goes to the push relay ("Device ID", app functionality, linked, as the relay keeps it per
  device, not tracking), and so does the privacy manifest.
- Every upload: raise `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`; raise `MARKETING_VERSION` for each public
  release. Both are the project's build settings, so the app and its extension keep one version
  ([docs/native-app.md](../../docs/native-app.md#the-app-app)).
