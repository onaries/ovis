; The desktop app replaces Ovis for Windows (app/windows, the one-file setup app):
; replace-old-setup.ps1 closes that app's windows and takes its shortcuts off the PC, and its copy and
; sign-in start too unless herdr says the Ovis plugin is installed (then they keep starting herdr's server
; at sign-in). herdr, the Ovis server and their state stay as they are. customInstall runs after this app's Start
; menu shortcut is made; when that shortcut was one of that app's (an update keeps the shortcut it
; finds) and the script removed it, it is made again here. One the user deleted stays deleted.

; The one-click installer's bar follows the files it unpacks, then stands still while the template copies
; them into place with no progress of its own (tens of seconds, Defender scanning each file), which reads
; as a hang. Once the "Installing" window is up, its bars run as a marquee instead: always moving, never
; a percentage. This hook is the template's check that the app is not running, which still runs first;
; the template leaves out what that check uses when the hook is defined, so it is included here.

; Removing the app (not the old version's uninstall an update runs) stops the herdr-core server the
; app started (HC_SESSION=ovis, from its copy in the app's data folder, README.md): quitting the app
; leaves it running on purpose, but with the app gone nothing could stop or update it. Best effort,

; there: it is named after this package (package.json name, as electron-updater names it).
