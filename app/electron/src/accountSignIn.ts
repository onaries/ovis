/**
 * Signing in to the account from the desktop app (docs/account.md, "Signing in"): the provider's
 * page opens in the system browser, and the account service sends it back to a server on this
 * machine's loopback address, `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`, with the code and state in the
 * query (RFC 8252). The page itself finishes the sign-in, as in a browser; this only carries the
 * return. One sign-in at a time; a new one ends the one before. Only a return naming the state of
 * the sign-in the app opened, with a code or an error, ends the wait: anything else that finds the
 * port is turned away and the wait goes on.
