# Ovis in one line, from a PC that may have none of it yet:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://ovis.sh/install.sh | sh
#
# 1. Installs what is missing, for this user only and without sudo: herdr (its own installer, into
#    ~/.local/bin) and Bun (its own installer, into ~/.bun). Terminals run on the release's Rust PTY
#    host, checked against its SHA-256; only when that cannot be installed, Node 22 (the official
#    build, checked against its published SHA-256, into ~/.local/share/ovis/node) runs them instead.
# 2. Installs Ovis as a herdr plugin, so it starts with herdr and Settings → Updates keeps it
#    current, and starts it now when herdr is running.
# 3. When Tailscale runs on this PC, serves the app to your tailnet (`tailscale serve`, on the first
#    free HTTPS port, or only the one OVIS_TAILSCALE_HTTPS_PORT names) and prints the address
#    a phone opens as a QR code (scripts/plugin.ts phone).
# 4. On a first install, mentions a GitHub star once. When the gh CLI is signed in and has not
#    starred the repository, it asks at the terminal, for 20 seconds, and stars only on "y"; it
#    never stars by itself.
#
# Run it again at any time: what is already there is kept, and step 3 is repeated.
#   OVIS_REF=<branch or tag>   install that ref instead of the latest release
#   OVIS_TAILSCALE_HTTPS_PORT=<port>   serve the app on that HTTPS port only, keeping 443 free
