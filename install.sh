# Ovis in one line, from a PC that may have none of it yet:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://ovis.sh/install.sh | sh
#
# 1. Installs what is missing, for this user only and without sudo: herdr (its own installer, into
#    ~/.local/bin), and the release's compiled server into ~/.local/share/ovis: ovis-server for this
#    platform and the built client (ovis-dist.tar.gz), taken only once the release's ovis-server.json
#    carries a valid signature by the key pinned below (RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY) and each file has the size
#    and SHA-256 it names, then made the one that runs by a single rename (install_binary). No Bun or
#    Node is installed or needed. Terminals run on the release's Rust PTY host, checked against its
#    SHA-256; where it cannot run, they are mirrored.
# 2. Installs Ovis as a herdr plugin (a small plugin folder, ~/.local/share/ovis/plugin, that herdr
#    links and that runs the binary), so it starts with herdr, and starts it now when herdr is running.
#
# A release from before the compiled server, a branch (OVIS_REF), an install from source that is
# already here, or OVIS_FROM_SOURCE=1 keep the earlier way instead: Bun (its own installer, into
# ~/.bun), herdr's plugin checkout built from source, which Settings → Updates keeps current, and Node
# 22 (the official build, checked against its published SHA-256) only where the Rust PTY host cannot
# be installed.
# 3. When Tailscale runs on this PC, serves the app to your tailnet (`tailscale serve`, on the first
#    free HTTPS port, or only the one OVIS_TAILSCALE_HTTPS_PORT names) and prints the address
#    a phone opens as a QR code (scripts/plugin.ts phone).
# 4. On a first install, mentions a GitHub star once. When the gh CLI is signed in and has not
#    starred the repository, it asks at the terminal, for 20 seconds, and stars only on "y"; it
#    never stars by itself.
#
# It also puts an `ovis` command into ~/.local/bin, which runs the installed Ovis's own command line
# (scripts/plugin.ts): `ovis add` adds this PC to your Ovis account from its terminal, `ovis pair` shows
# a pairing code, `ovis status` says whether the app runs. To end the install with `ovis add`:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://ovis.sh/install.sh | sh -s -- --add
#
# That step needs a terminal to sign in and answer at; without one the installer says what to run.
#
# On a PC with herdr-core (hc, the core the Herdr app runs on) and no herdr, steps 1 and 2 are instead:
# the compiled server alone (from source: Bun, and Ovis in its own checkout, ~/.local/share/ovis/app),
# started on herdr-core (OVIS_RUNTIME=herdr-core) as a user service that starts again at login
# (systemd's on Linux, launchd's on macOS).
#
# Run it again at any time: what is already there is kept, and step 3 is repeated.
#   OVIS_REF=<branch or tag>   install that ref instead of the latest release (a branch: from source)
#   OVIS_RELEASES_URL=<https:// address or file:// folder>   where releases are downloaded from,
#     laid out as GitHub's (<url>/v<version>/<file>); the pinned key checks the server, its client and the
#     Rust PTY host from any of them the same
#   OVIS_FROM_SOURCE=1   install from source as before the compiled server
#   OVIS_RUNTIME=herdr|herdr-core   pick the runtime instead of going by what is installed
#   OVIS_TAILSCALE_HTTPS_PORT=<port>   serve the app on that HTTPS port only, keeping 443 free
#   OVIS_ADD=1   the same as --add, for where the installer's arguments cannot be given
