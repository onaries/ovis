# Ovis

Browser UI for the herdr terminal multiplexer: a React 19 + xterm.js client (`src/`), a Bun
backend (`server/`) that bridges herdr's unix-socket API, and the wire contract both import
(`shared/`). herdr owns every pty, scrollback and agent state; this app is only a bridge.

These files hold only the traps the code and tests do not show. Commands, layout, checks and
release steps are in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md); contributors follow
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Code conventions (imports, CSS tokens, i18n entries, fixed
sleeps, wording, icons) are enforced by the `conventions.test.ts` files, whose failures say what
to change. Also read [server/AGENTS.md](server/AGENTS.md) and [src/AGENTS.md](src/AGENTS.md).

## Bridge traps
- Never load node-pty inside Bun: it panics the runtime. PTY work goes through the Rust PTY host
  (`crates/pty-sidecar`), or the Node sidecar as its fallback, never in-process.
- Never pass `--takeover` to `herdr terminal attach` on the server's own initiative; it cuts off
  whoever holds the pane. Only a user's explicit take-over request may.
- One herdr RPC connection per call: herdr closes the socket after each answer. Only
  `events.subscribe` stays open, and a second subscribe on it is ignored, so reopen with the full
  set. Caching answers is fine.
- `pane.process_info` takes `pane_id`, not `target` (with `target` herdr answers for the focused
  pane).
- Keep xterm `scrollback: 0` and never rebuild an attached terminal from `pane.read`: the attach
  stream is the truth. Only a mirrored pane (Windows, or no PTY host: neither the Rust host nor Node) is drawn from
  `pane.read`, so never assume a pty exists.
- Nothing the user typed is sent automatically after a disconnect: it waits in a draft until the
  user sends or discards it.
- Prompt answers go through `POST /api/pane/prompt/answer`, never guessed digit keys.
- Selecting a pane or tab in the browser never moves herdr's own focus; only an explicit action
  that needs it calls `pane.focus`.
- Never edit `shared/herdr-api.generated.ts`; run `bun run generate:types`.
- Theme colors are edited only in the theme blocks of `src/styles.css`. Never edit
  `src/lib/themes.generated.ts` or the generated copies in DESIGN.md, index.html and
  `public/manifest.webmanifest`; run `bun run generate:themes`.

## Tests and QA
- Tests never touch the user's herdr session or real state: they use the isolated test session,
  a `mkdtempSync` `stateDir` and `port: 0` for every `createServer`. Never run the real
  `herdr update` in a test.
- Screenshots and recordings come from the demo or a test session, never the user's live one.
- An Ovis server an agent starts for someone to open (manual QA, a preview) binds to this PC's
  Tailscale address, not loopback: `HOST=$(tailscale ip -4) PORT=<free port> bun run server`,
  then hand over `http://<that address>:<port>`. A Tailscale-only bind stays inside the tailnet
  (`lanExposed` in `server/access.ts`); never bind `0.0.0.0` for it. Tests keep `port: 0` on
  loopback.
- That bind is for a throwaway preview only. A server someone installs as an app from another
  device needs HTTPS (only `localhost` installs over plain http): bind it to `127.0.0.1` and let
  `tailscale serve` add the address. Moving a port that `tailscale serve` already fronts to the
  Tailscale address breaks that HTTPS address.
- The maintainer's "herdr main" test app always serves the latest main at
  `https://home-server.tail1e211e.ts.net:17421` (user unit `herdr-web-main.service`, which
  follows origin/main by itself). Open it to try main instead of starting another main preview,
  and never stop it.
- Mac and iOS Simulator checks run on the maintainer's test MacBook Air, `ssh eamac`, which stays
  awake for it. Never drive the MacBook Pro (`ssh macbook`, `ssh mymac`): it is the maintainer's
  working machine, and automation there takes over their keyboard and focus. Native Windows
  checks run on the maintainer's Windows 11 PC, `ssh home-window`, which never sleeps on AC. On
  either box, run a PR's checks in a fresh `git clone` in a temporary directory (`/tmp` on eamac,
  `%TEMP%` on Windows) and delete it afterwards. Leave their own checkouts alone.

## Maintainer workflow
- A session that changes code, in any harness, stops at an open PR: only the maintainer's merge
  pass merges, unless the maintainer asks that session to merge. One session that edits files per
  worktree; read-only sessions may share it.
- A worktree an agent adds with `git worktree add` that outlives its session (an open PR) goes
  under `~/.herdr/worktrees/herdr-web-ui-wt/`, named after its branch with `/` as `-`
  (`fix/pin-order` in `herdr-web-ui-wt/fix-pin-order`); a short-lived one may stay in the run's
  temp root, and skills that name their own path keep it. Once its PR merges, remove the
  worktree and its branch.
- After a merge, the merge pass also closes the herdr worktree workspace the PR came from (the
  one checked out on the PR's branch, under `~/.herdr/worktrees/herdr-web-ui/`), only when all
  hold: no pane in it has an agent `working`, `git status` there is clean, and the branch's tip
  is the PR's head commit (`gh pr view --json headRefOid`), so nothing was added after it. Close
  it with `herdr worktree remove --workspace <id>`, never `git worktree remove`, so the
  workspace leaves with its checkout. herdr keeps the branch: then `git branch -D` it (a squash
  merge leaves it unmerged to git; GitHub already deletes the remote one). A workspace that
  fails a check stays, and the merge report names it and why. A session never removes the
  worktree it runs in.
- Everything written to git and GitHub (commits, branches, PRs, reviews, issues, changelog
  fragments) is in English.
- Never push a `v*` tag by hand: installed updaters act on tags alone.
- The merge pass cuts releases ([steps](docs/development.md#releasing)); any other session may
  prepare the release PR but stops at it. When that PR raises `REMOTE_BUNDLE_VERSION`, the merge
  pass merges nothing touching `server/`, `shared/`, `bun.lock` or `patches/` from its merge until
  the Release run is done.
- Required checks: Fast checks, Integration and browser, Native Windows install. Resolve review
  threads before merging (branch protection does not enforce it).
- Run `bun run check fast` before every push, and push a PR's commits together: each push to a
  PR cancels its CI run in progress and starts every job again.
- CodeRabbit's reviews are rationed per PR author, and agents open their PRs as one account:
  opening a PR, a push and each `@coderabbitai review` spend one, and past about 80 in a week
  one comes back per hour. Open verified work ready for review, not as a draft: the merge pass
  reviews every PR itself and stops at a draft. A draft is only for work still unfinished; push
  it once when it is ready. Do not open a stack of PRs at once, and ask for another review
  only after a commit that changes behaviour in `server/`, `src/` or `shared/`, an HTTP/WS
  contract or a workflow. A rebase, changelog fragment, docs, comment or test-only commit gets
  none.
- A rate-limited or skipped review still shows a passing CodeRabbit check; its "Review limit
  reached" or "Review skipped" comment means no review ran. CodeRabbit skips a PR of more than
  150 files, so a PR that needs a review stays under that.
- A PR touching `--takeover`, observe permissions, queued input, authentication, an HTTP/WS
  contract or a workflow waits for a real review. When CodeRabbit skips it, a code-review agent's
  review stands in: its findings and how each was resolved go in a PR comment before the merge.
- A move-only PR (files moved or split, imports updated, no behaviour change) does not wait for
  CodeRabbit: it merges on its checks once its diff shows only moved code and import paths
  (`git diff --color-moved origin/main...HEAD`). Every PR merged without a CodeRabbit review
  says so in a comment, and any other PR merges on its checks and the maintainer.
- Changelog entries go in `changelog.d/` fragments ([format](changelog.d/README.md)), not
  CHANGELOG.md; only a release folds them in.
