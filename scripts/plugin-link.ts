/**
 * `link`: a PC with no screen of its own joins the relay from its terminal (docs/relay.md, "A PC
 * with no screen"). Both ways are the ones its own Settings page offers, through the same routes:
 *
 * - `link`: sign in to the account with a device code (as a PC's own page does,
 *   src/lib/account/deviceSignIn.ts): the Ovis link page's where the service has it, else, or with
 *   `--github` / `--google`, the provider's own device flow. Then list this PC in the account (src/lib/account/addThisPc.ts),
 *   then approve here, after comparing six digits, the device of the account that adds it.
 * - `link --code`: the code to type and the relay QR code that Connect a device shows, renewed
 *   as they run out, until Ctrl+C.
 *
 * It talks only to a server on this machine (a loopback address): approving a device is an act of
 * the PC itself (docs/account.md, "Who may admit a device"), and the sign-in lives in this process.
