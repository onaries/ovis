/**
 * `link`: a PC with no screen of its own joins the relay from its terminal (docs/relay.md, "A PC
 * with no screen"). Both ways are the ones its own Settings page offers, through the same routes:
 *
 * - `link` (also `add` and `login`, COMMAND_ALIASES): sign in to the account with a device code (as a PC's own page does,
 *   src/lib/account/deviceSignIn.ts): the Ovis link page's where the service has it, else, or with
 *   `--github` / `--google`, the provider's own device flow. Then list this PC in the account (src/lib/account/addThisPc.ts),
 *   then show one QR code: a device signed in to that account that scans it puts this PC in the account, with nothing
 *   to type and nothing to approve here (docs/account.md, "Who may admit a device": a code admits whoever holds it).
 *   So the code is shown only on a terminal (or with `--print`), on a screen of its own that goes when it ends, for
 *   30 minutes at most, and the command says which account this PC joined and by which of its devices. Any other
 *   device the code let in is asked about, and removed unless the person types keep; with this PC in another account
 *   than the one that signed in, every device that came since the code was shown is removed.
 * - `link --approve`: the same sign-in, then approve here, after comparing six digits, the device of the account that
 *   adds it.
 * - `link --code`: the code to type and the relay QR code that Connect a device shows, renewed
 *   as they run out, until Ctrl+C.
 *
 * It talks only to a server on this machine (a loopback address): approving a device is an act of
 * the PC itself (docs/account.md, "Who may admit a device"), and the sign-in lives in this process.

 * with such a device unanswered for (Ctrl+C, a SIGTERM, the terminal closing, the 30 minutes, an error) removes it.
 * A PC that ended in another account than the one that signed in was put there by a device the code let in, which
 * anyone signed in to any account can be: every device that came since the first code is then removed without a
 * question, that account's members among them, since a PC with no screen has no other place to revoke them. Each
