# Picks the runner for ci.yml's Linux jobs and prints `linux=<json>` for $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
# A fork pull request always gets the GitHub-hosted image: its code must never reach the
# self-hosted runner. Otherwise the workflow_dispatch input wins over the repository variable
# CI_SELF_HOSTED_LABELS. With neither, a push goes to the maintainer PC's runners
# (scripts/self-hosted-runner/, label self-hosted-ovis), a same-repository pull request goes there
# only while they have room for its Linux jobs and to ubuntu-24.04 otherwise, and any other event
# stays on ubuntu-24.04. "Room" is counted from the Actions API, since the workflow token cannot
# list runners: CI_SELF_HOSTED_CAPACITY (default 10) minus the queued and running jobs of every
# workflow that could take those runners must leave at least the jobs one run needs. When that count
# fails, the pull request stays hosted. Setting the variable to labels sends every pull request to
# them, and the value "ubuntu-24.04" (a JSON string, which pages.yml and
# release.yml also accept) keeps every job hosted while that PC is offline. A push to main takes the
# repository variable CI_MAIN_SELF_HOSTED_LABELS over CI_SELF_HOSTED_LABELS when it is set, so main's
# runs go to runners pull requests never use (run.sh --reserved); "ubuntu-24.04" there keeps only
# main hosted, and deleting it puts main back on the shared runners. This script runs from the
# checked-out revision, which a fork pull request controls; the runner itself refuses fork code
# (scripts/self-hosted-runner/job-started.sh).
