/**
 * The hosted shell in a real browser against a real PC: dist-shell/ served as Cloudflare Pages
 * would serve it (pages-static.ts) under its enforced policy, a real `createServer` on the
 * isolated herdr test session with its relay turned on, and the Bun relay (relay/bun.ts) between
 * them. It builds the shell itself (as `bun run build:shell` does) into a folder of its own, so it
 * never runs against a dist-shell/ older than the checkout. The browser lane (scripts/ci-browser.sh)
 * runs it through relay-e2e-regression.ts, which calls `relayShellQa` with its own server tree; run
 * alone, the script makes that tree itself.
 *
 * The shell accepts only a wss: relay, and the PC's server only a wss: relay origin, so both name
 * `wss://relay.test`: the server's outbound sockets reach the local relay through the service's
 * `connect` seam, and the browser's through Playwright's WebSocket routing, bridged here frame by
 * frame to the same relay. The bridge can also hold a connection, stay silent, or find the relay
 * gone, which is how the states no happy path reaches are driven.
 *
 *   UI_EVIDENCE_DIR=<dir> bun scripts/relay-shell-browser-qa.ts
 *
 * writes the screenshots and logs there (task-16-*, task-18-* for push alerts, task-9-* for the sign-in screen and
 * dashboard, dashboard-matrix/ for relay-dashboard-browser-qa.ts, which runs last on fixture fleets); without it the
 * checks still run.
 *
 * The sign-in screen and the dashboard need the account service, which the shell offers on app.ovis.sh alone
 * (lib/account/service.ts shellAccountServiceOf): that part routes https://app.ovis.sh to the same built shell and
 * https://account.ovis.sh to the in-memory account service (shared/account-service-fake.ts), which its PCs use too.
 *
 * Headless Chrome has no push service: each PC's server pushes to a fake one (server/push.fake.ts,
 * which decrypts what it gets as a browser would), and the page's PushManager hands over that
 * fake's subscription for its PC's scope. Everything between them is real: the VAPID key and the
 * registration go over the relay, and the worker's pushsubscriptionchange runs in the real worker.
