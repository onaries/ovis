/**
 * The release's server, installed for one platform: what scripts/plugin-launch.ts runs before it hands a command to
 * the binary (install.sh and install.ps1 do the same in shell and PowerShell). Nothing in the install changes until the
 * manifest's signature by the committed key (RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY), its version, and the size and SHA-256 of every file
 * it names have been checked; then one rename makes the new release the one that runs:
 *
 *   <home>/bin -> releases/<version>-<id>   the release that runs: ovis-server(.exe), dist/, the manifest and its
 *                                           signature as they were checked, and bin/ovis-pty-sidecar(.json): the
 *                                           Rust PTY host the signed manifest names, when it runs here
 *   <home>/releases/.stage-<id>             a download in progress; one an interrupted run left is removed first
 *
 * On Windows, where a link needs rights a user may not have, bin is the release folder itself, moved in by two
 * renames (the old one aside, the new one in); a run cut off between them finds the old one and moves it back.
 *
 * One install at a time: <home>/.install.lock, made with an atomic mkdir and holding the holder's pid. Another install
 * waits for it (at most LOCK_WAIT_MS), then finds that version installed and has nothing to do, or installs its own; a
 * lock whose holder is gone is broken, one breaker at a time (with three or more installs started at the same instant a
 * narrow race remains, a follow-up). Only the lock holder makes
 * a stage, so what the holder removes of releases/ belongs to no other run.
