 * directory is never written again: builds running at once in one checkout (the browser lane's
 * workers) read it while another may be emitting, and a module rewritten in place reads as missing
 * its exports (#2021). A new one is emitted into a private directory renamed into place whole; a
 * build that loses that rename to another uses the other's.
 *
 * TypeScript compiles the very bytes that were hashed, never the files as they are on disk by then: a
 * source changed in between would otherwise be published under the old source's key (#2148).
