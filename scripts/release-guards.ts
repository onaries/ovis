/**
 * What a release forgets when nobody remembers it: the remote PC bundle, the telemetry Worker and
 * the release metadata. A tree is a release when its package.json version has no `v<version>` tag
 * yet. In CI that is only the change that bumps the version against `--base` (the release PR and
 * main's push of its merge): main keeps the untagged version until the Release run, and the PRs
 * merged meanwhile neither own the release nor can fix it, so they pass. The Release run checks the
 * whole tree again, server changes merged in that window included.
 *
 *   bun scripts/release-guards.ts --base <sha>      CI (ci.yml, Fast checks): a remote-vN tag may still be unpublished
 *   bun scripts/release-guards.ts --release X.Y.Z   release.yml preflight: remote-vN must be published from this tree,
 *                                                   its manifest and archives downloadable, not only tagged
 *   bun scripts/release-guards.ts --worker-deployed after `wrangler deploy`: records the Worker in telemetry/deployed.json
 *
 * Reads tags, so a shallow checkout fetches them first (ci.yml does).
