# Moves the client builds that trusted jobs left in their slots' outboxes into the build cache
# (README "Build cache"). Runner containers get the cache read-only: a job only writes its own
# slot's outbox, `<key>.tar` and then `<key>.claim` (its GITHUB_RUN_ID and GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT). This
# runs on the host, as the launcher's user, and takes a build only when GitHub says the slot is
# running a job of that run and the run is trusted: a push to the default branch, or a pull request
# from this repository that --writer opened and pushed. Every other outbox file is deleted.
#
# Usage: build-cache-promote.sh REPO CACHE_ROOT OUTBOXES WRITER MAX_MB SLOT_NAME...
#   CACHE_ROOT holds entries/ (the cache) and used/ (when each was last restored), both written only
#   here; OUTBOXES holds a directory per runner, named after it; WRITER may be empty. A restore says it used an entry
#   with an empty outbox file used-<key>, of which only the name is read.
