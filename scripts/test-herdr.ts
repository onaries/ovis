/**
 * Tests talk to their own herdr: a headless server for the named session
 * `ovis-test` (HERDR_TEST_SESSION overrides), started on first use and left
 * running for the next run. The workspaces, panes and agents the tests create never
 * show in the herdr the user works in.
 *
 * `bun test` loads this first (bunfig.toml); the browser and SSH scripts import it.
 * HERDR_TEST_LIVE=1 keeps the old behaviour: tests use HERDR_SOCKET, else the default
 * session. Without a herdr binary nothing changes, so CI runs as before.
 * HERDR_TEST_MODE=unit points HERDR_SOCKET at a socket that does not exist, so a test that
 * reaches for herdr in a unit run fails instead of working in the user's herdr.
