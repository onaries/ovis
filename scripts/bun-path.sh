# bare one. Sourced by preflight.sh and with-bun.sh. The home directory's own places come before
# a version manager's shims and Homebrew. The Node install.sh installs is not among them: the
# server finds it itself (server/pty/sidecar.ts). WITH_BUN_EXTRA_DIRS, a list written like PATH,
# replaces these places.
