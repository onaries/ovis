/**
 * Whether a Release run may take main's own CI as the validation of its commit instead of running
 * ci.yml a second time. .github/workflows/release-validate.yml asks before it calls ci.yml.
 *
 * The answer is yes only for the one push run of ci.yml on main for that exact commit, in this
 * repository, completed with success on its first or second attempt, with every job of ci.yml in
 * it and passed. Anything else is a no, and release-validate.yml then runs ci.yml as it always
 * did: no such run or several, another event, branch, commit or repository, a job that failed, was
 * cancelled or skipped, a job this file does not list, a run waiting behind another run of main, or
 * an answer from GitHub that cannot be read. A run still going is waited for until
 * RELEASE_CI_WAIT_SECONDS have passed or one of its jobs ends without passing. A no only costs a
 * second CI run: it never fails a release.
 *
 *   GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_SHA   the commit the Release run publishes
 *   GH_TOKEN                        reads the Actions API (actions: read)
 *   GITHUB_API_URL                  that API, as the runner names it (default https://api.github.com)
 *   REVALIDATE                      the Release run's revalidate input: anything but false is a no, without asking GitHub
 *   RELEASE_CI_WAIT_SECONDS         how long a run still going is waited for (default 2400)
 *
 * Prints `green=true|false` and `run=<id>` for $GITHUB_OUTPUT on stdout and nothing else there (the
 * id only with a yes); what it found goes to stderr and the job summary. It exits 0 whatever happens.
