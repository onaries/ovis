/**
 * herdr plugin lifecycle for the web UI.
 *
 * herdr's startup hooks are one-shot initialization commands, not supervised
 * daemons (https://herdr.dev/docs/plugins/), so this script owns the process:
 * `start` detaches the server and records its pid under HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR,
 * `stop` takes it down, `status` reports, `pair` prints a pairing code for another device, `phone`
 * publishes the app to the user's tailnet and prints its address as a QR code. Start is idempotent — a server that is
 * already answering on the port is left alone, which is what makes it safe as
 * both a startup hook and a hand-invoked action.
 *
 * The port is settled here, before the server is spawned: with no PORT set, a default that cannot
 * be opened gives way to the next one that can (scripts/plugin-port.ts), and that choice is kept
 * for later starts and for `status`, `pair` and `phone`.
 *
 * Two pieces of herdr's runtime environment have to be translated:
 * - herdr injects HERDR_SOCKET_PATH; the server reads HERDR_SOCKET. Without the
 *   mapping a named session's plugin would talk to the default socket.
 * - plugin commands inherit herdr's environment, not the user's shell, so the
 *   token and any overrides are read from `env` and `.env` in HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR.
