/**
 * Settings → Terminal → Follow herdr's focus (#311) against a real herdr: a tab herdr opens and
 * brings to the front by itself (`herdr tab create --focus`, as a script does) is opened here only
 * once this device asked for it, and herdr's focus moving back brings this device back too. It
 * never takes the view while this window is in front and someone types into it or has a dialog
 * open, and a split this device opens itself stays its own pick when herdr's frame for it comes
 * first (#1470). Imported by ui-regression.ts, with Settings closed; it ends on the pane selected
 * when it began and with the setting off, also when it fails.
