/**
 * The server as one compiled binary, whose first argument names the entry it runs (server/entries.ts):
 *
 *   bun scripts/build-server.ts <platform> <dir>   <dir>/ovis-server (ovis-server.exe on Windows), with the Node PTY
 *                                                 host script beside it; it serves dist/ from OVIS_ASSETS, else
 *                                                 from its own folder
 *   bun scripts/build-server.ts release <dir>      the five platforms' binaries as a release names them, and the built
 *                                                 client (dist/, from bun run build) as ovis-dist.tar.gz
 *   bun scripts/build-server.ts manifest <dir>     ovis-server.json and ovis-server.SHA256SUMS for those
 *   bun scripts/build-server.ts sign <dir> [--public-key <base64>]
 *                                                 ovis-server.json.sig, with the private key in OVIS_SERVER_SIGNING_KEY,
 *                                                 only when its public half is RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY (scripts/server-manifest.ts)
 *                                                 or the key the flag names (a test's own); prints that public key
 *   bun scripts/build-server.ts verify <dir> [--public-key <base64>] [--expect-version <X.Y.Z>]
 *                                                 the folder, the signature (by RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY unless the flag names
 *                                                 another), the manifest, every file and the sums; exit 1 with one line
 *                                                 naming what does not match. A consumer passes the version it asked for:
 *                                                 the signature alone does not stop an older release being offered
 *   bun scripts/build-server.ts keygen <dir>       a new signing key pair, once, for the owner (docs/development.md)
 *
 * Platforms: linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, windows-x64. What else a folder that runs the binary
 * holds is scripts/server-artifact.ts; how the release signs and attaches these files is .github/workflows/release.yml.
